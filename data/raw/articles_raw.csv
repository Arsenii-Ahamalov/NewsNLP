The two men will have their first formal bilateral meeting, after a few phone calls and a brief encounter in New York City last month. The meeting is expected to occur in the very early hours of Tuesday morning, Australian time. Albanese stepped on to his official plane on Sunday, right after arriving back from an overseas holiday. We will look forward to hearing from the PM after we land in Washington DC later today. Albanese is accompanied on this trip by the resources minister, Madeleine King, and industry minister, Tim Ayres – underscoring the likelihood that critical minerals will be a key point of discussion for the Trump-Albanese meeting, alongside issues around Aukus, defence and trade. Related: Anthony Albanese is heading to the White House to meet Donald Trump. Here’s what he hopes to talk about Albanese said in a written statement before departure he was looking forward “to a positive and constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House”. The defence minister, Richard Marles, is acting as prime minister until Tuesday night, then the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will act as PM from Tuesday night until Albanese’s return later in the week. Updated at 9.34pm BST 9.22pm BST Good morning And welcome to Monday. The sky is falling! Nick Visser here to guide you through the morning’s news. Here’s what’s on deck. Suspected space debris was discovered near a mine site in Western Australia this weekend after workers found a burning object near a remote access road. Early assessments indicate it was made of carbon fibre and may be some kind of pressure vessel or rocket tank. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, had a brief stop in Honolulu, Hawaii, a few hours ago before continuing on his way to Washington DC for his meeting with the US president, Donald Trump. Their first formal meeting will be very early tomorrow morning Australian time. The federal government is set to release a draft of proposed laws to crack down on supermarket price gouging. The prime minister said earlier this year companies could be liable for “heavy fines” if found to be charging excessive prices. Stick with us."
1,Formula One: United States Grand Prix – live updates,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/oct/19/formula-one-united-states-grand-prix-live-updates,Sport,2025-10-19 20:34:02,Beau Dure,"9.34pm BST Lap 53/56: The Norris lead over Leclerc is now 3.3 seconds. Verstappen is out of sight, of course – 8.5 seconds in front. The only problem would be if Norris slides outside the track limit. If he gets another 1.5 seconds on Leclerc, a five-second penalty won’t matter. 9.32pm BST And that’s likely the last action we’ll have aside from the back five. Alonso is holding on to 10th. 9.31pm BST Lap 52/56: Leclerc radio says to keep the pressure on because Norris has three strikes. But he’s already more than a second ahead. Make it 1.5. Leclerc is going backwards. 9.30pm BST Norris passes Leclerc! It all looked so easy there. 9.29pm BST And no, Russell still isn’t gaining on Piastri. 9.29pm BST Lap 51/56: Norris takes a shot! He tries to get inside, but Leclerc slams the door, and Norris wisely backs off. 9.28pm BST Lap 50/56: Reminder – if Norris goes outside the track limits again, he’ll lose five seconds. He can gamble because he has more than 12 seconds on the fading Hamilton, but if he goes for it, he’d better make it work. 9.27pm BST Lap 49/56: Make it 1.2 seconds. My goodness. Have Leclerc’s medium tires suddenly fallen apart? Verstappen is still more than seven seconds ahead. The commentators have suddenly noticed that Russell is within three seconds of Piastri, but the gap is the same as it was several laps ago. He’s not “gaining.” Not yet, anyway. 9.25pm BST Lap 48/56: Well, well, well … Norris is suddenly within 1.6 seconds. 9.24pm BST We have five races left. Two of them have sprints. Verstappen could certainly get 120 points or so, for a total of 426. That means Piastri would need 81 – the equivalent of hitting the podium in each race and getting six more points somewhere. You really can’t like Norris’s chances of holding off Verstappen in the least. 9.21pm BST Lap 46/56: Points if these standings hold … Verstappen 25 (306 on the season)Leclerc 18 (195)Norris 15 (329)Hamilton 12 (142)Piastri 10 (346)Russell 8 (252) 9.18pm BST Lap 44/56: That said – Verstappen was a little faster than Leclerc on his last lap. Norris is dropping farther behind Leclerc, but Hamilton’s on the same tires behind him and isn’t gaining. Piastri’s quest to hold fifth is also looking solid. The big contest coming up will be for 10th, where Alonso has Lawson and Stroll right behind him. 9.17pm BST Lap 43/56: It appears Norris wasn’t bluffing. Replay shows him sliding around. And Verstappen now says he is sliding around a lot. Leclerc is on mediums. Would we see the rest of the top 10 pit to ditch these underperforming tires, leaving Leclerc to take his second straight win in Texas? 9.15pm BST Lap 42/56: Norris says his tires are “gone.” That seems fishy. A bluff? But hew has dropped a bit farther behind Leclerc. Verstappen is informed that Norris is complaining about his tires, so he should look after his. That 6.8-second gap will make that task easier. 9.14pm BST Greatest collapses … Ger Nugent: “Barça VS Liverpool champions league. Bayern Munich Vs Man U final.” Mark Woldin objects to the Greg Norman comparison: “That was one day. We have to think of a season. There have been many. But McClaren is not collapsing. Max is great and his car is better than before.” Nicola Wilson: “Newcastle United Football Club 95/96. McLaren’s antics have taken me back to my 10 year old self... although I’m actually enjoying it. Papaya Ruled too close to the sun.” Paul Overtoom points out that this race is not done. 9.12pm BST Lap 40/56: As you were. Getting email now … 9.10pm BST Lap 38/56: So our top 10, with the potential for changes … 1. Verstappen will win, barring mishap2. Leclerc – the wild card here is that his medium tires may be better at the end3. Norris is gaining on Leclerc, so that could be our most significant change4. Hamilton is by himself5. Piastri seems OK for now6. Russell may yet have a chance of getting past Piastri, but he has work to do7. Tsunoda has nearly wrappup up seventh8. Hulkenberg has to hold off …9. Bearman10. Alonso is well back and may yet be challenged by Lawson, Stroll (medium), Ocon (medium) and the charging Antonelli, who clearly has a ton of pace today and would likely be in the top five if not for his unfortunate spin.Everyone else is on softs. 9.07pm BST Lap 37/57: It’s interesting that Hamilton has emerged nearly 10 seconds behind his teammate Leclerc. Before everyone pitted, he was on Leclerc’s rear wing. Albon is pitting again. He had the early incident and pitted early, so that’s no surprise. Bortoleto is also pitting for some reason. Antonelli is up to 14th. 9.05pm BST Lap 36/56: Verstappen is pulling away again. Norris is gaining on Leclerc. Antonelli wound up 17th again after everyone pitted but has posted the fastest lap again. 9.04pm BST Lap 35/56: Hulkenberg fans will be happy to see that he moved up to fifth, but that was pre-pit. With that, every driver has pitted, and the situation is: Verstappen – only 5.771 ahead of Leclerc nowLeclerc – medium tiresNorrisHamiltonPiastriRussellTsunodaBearmanHulkenberg Albon – mediumEveryone else in the top 10 is on softs.Bearman tries to pass Tsunoda but locks up. He manages to keep going, and Tsunoda is lucky to have avoided the skidding Bearman. We’ll see if stewards take action against Tsunoda for dodgy defending. 9.01pm BST Lap 34/54: Our new leader is George Russell. Don’t get too excited. He hasn’t pitted, while Verstappen has just zipped in and out of the pit lane. Now Russell will pit. 9.00pm BST Lap 33/56: Norris pits. The stop takes nearly four seconds. He comes out nearly four seconds behind Leclerc. Things are shaping up horribly for McLaren here. 8.59pm BST Lap 32/56: Hamilton pits. He re-emerges in sixth, once again ahead of Piastri. Antonelli pits. He did a masterful job of recovering from his early spin. Leclerc has posted the fastest lap. 8.57pm BST Lap 31/56: Piastri pits. He’ll be on soft tires, which will surely be better than the mediums that were letting him down – but for how long? Russell goes about a mile outside track limits, so maybe his tires are starting to fail. 8.56pm BST Lap 30/56: Leclerc gets past Tsunoda into sixth. Tsunoda duly pits. Piastri tells McLaren he thinks it’d be difficult to go the rest of the way on soft tires. He’s still out there ahead of Russell, but the gap is dropping. The team asks him about undercutting. The nerves in Piastri’s voice are noticeable. 8.54pm BST Lap 29/56: Tim Brosnan has a contender for biggest collapse – Greg Norman at the Masters. Good choice. I should be able to come up with a soccer equivalent at some point, but it’s escaping my brain so far. 8.52pm BST Lap 28/56: We’re at the halfway point, and Russell is slowly gaining on Piastri. Can McLaren hold out a little longer before changing tires? The only driver in the top 10 who has pitted is Leclerc, who is ninth. Oops – eighth. Make it seventh, as he passes Bearman. Verstappen’s team tells him to make his tires last a bit longer. Must be nice to have a 10-second cushion. 8.50pm BST Lap 27/56: Standings at the moment … 1. Verstappen2. Norris (more than 11 seconds back)3. Hamilton (more than five seconds back of Norris)4. Piastri5. Russell (still nearly two seconds back)6. Tsunoda7. Bearman8. Leclerc (just passed Hulkenberg)9. Hulkenberg10. Alonso11. Lawson12. Stroll13. Gasly14. Antonelli15. Colapinto16. Albon17. Hajduk18. Bortoleto19. Ocon(Sainz is out) 8.46pm BST Lap 25/56: Leclerc doesn’t seem to be pushing too hard on his new tires, perhaps hinting that he’ll stick with a one-stop strategy and nurse those tires until the end of the race. 8.45pm BST Lap 24/56: Leclerc comes out of the pits in ninth. Norris has nothing but clean air ahead of him because Verstappen is more than 10 seconds in front, but how long with the tires hold? Hamilton is third but isn’t gaining ground. Updated at 8.45pm BST 8.42pm BST Lap 22/56: McLaren’s pit crew gets on the radio to let Norris know about the track-limits warning. “I know, I know, I know,” says Norris. Now someone else is trying to pass Leclerc, and it’s his teammate, Lewis Hamilton! Leclerc defends with near-reckless zeal, and Ferrari has seen enough, telling him to pit so he can get rid of those soft tires. 8.41pm BST And as I type that, Norris whips past Leclerc on a straightaway and leaves Leclerc nothing going into the turn. 8.39pm BST Lap 21/56: Norris pulls within a car length of Leclerc, but he’s clearly chastened by his track-limits warnings – now one away from a five-second penalty – and doesn’t make a serious effort to pass. 8.38pm BST Lap 20/56: Again, Leclerc defends well, and Norris gets another track-limits warning. Seems like Leclerc should get one as well. Verstappen’s lead is now nine seconds. Pretty soon, he’ll be able to stop and sign autographs. 8.36pm BST Lap 19/56: Russell may think Piastri is slow at the moment, but he’s dropping farther behind the championship leader. Here goes Norris again … 8.35pm BST Lap 18/56: Norris stays close to Leclerc. Verstappen pulls farther away. Can Antonelli charge back from his spin to get into the points? He races past Hadjar into 16th. 8.32pm BST Lap 17/56: Norris now has two warnings for exceeding track limits, and Hamilton is getting a little closer to the McLaren driver. Russell has Piastri in his sights. Nervous moments for the constructors’ champions here. 8.31pm BST Lap 16/56: Norris and Leclerc have an epic battle through several turns, but Leclerc hangs on for now. If Norris can get past, he’s gone. He’s clearly faster. Meanwhile, Verstappen is more than six seconds in front. 8.28pm BST Lap 14/56: Russell to his team: “Piastri seems slow.” The response is that he’s having trouble with his front left. Yeah, we know. Russell’s still well more than a second back. Leclerc tattles on Norris exceeding track limits. How would he have that great of a view in his rearview mirror? Norris is within a half-second now. 8.27pm BST Lap 13/56: Norris is slowly reeling in Leclerc. Most of the rest of the field is spread out, especially in the top 10. Verstappen is more than four seconds in front of Leclerc. 8.25pm BST Lap 12/56: Antonelli rebounds from being spun out by posting the fastest lap time so far. Might be a question of having no traffic around him – he’s 18th, well behind Hadjar and well ahead of the unfortunate Albon. 8.23pm BST Reminder of the question of the day: If Verstappen rallies to win the championship (or, from another point of view, McLaren collapses), it’ll be the biggest rally (or collapse) since …? 8.23pm BST Lap 11/56: Piastri tells his team the front left doesn’t look great. He’s comfortably in fifth at the moment. New wrinkle: McLaren teammate Norris says the same thing. Radio tells Norris to go to Plan B. We’ll see what that is. 8.21pm BST Lap 10/56: Stewards will take a closer look at the Sainz-Antonelli incident after the race. Sainz is more likely the guilty party, and he’s out, so it’s not particularly relevant. Chatter is that the hard tires are not doing well, which means it’ll be difficult to pit early and still make it a one-stop race. 8.19pm BST Lap 9/56: The only driver to pit under the Virtual Safety Car is Albon, who was left behind at the start after bumping tires with Bortoleto and spinning 180 degrees. Tsunoda worked his way up six places to seventh. Can he hang on? Move up? 8.17pm BST Lap 8/56: Antonelli on race radio … “He took me out.” “Saw that mate.” “What a ****ing idiot.” Sainz on race radio says Antonelli turned into him. Stewards will certainly look at it, but Sainz is out anyway. 8.15pm BST Lap 7/56: Kimi Antonelli has spun out! He remains stationary for a few moments as the entire field passes him. He gets going again. Sainz has apparently hit Antonelli, and now Sainz is stopped. Virtual safety car is applied. 8.14pm BST Lap 6/56: Current standings VerstappenLeclercNorrisHamiltonPiastriRussellAntonelliSainzTsunodaBearmanHulkenbergAlonsoLawsonGaslyBortoletoColapintoStrollOconHadjukAlbon 8.12pm BST Lap 5/56: Verstappen is more than three seconds ahead already, benefiting from the three-way battle for second behind him but also benefiting from posting the fastest lap. Brad Pitt’s character in the F1 film was right – Verstappen’s pretty good. 8.11pm BST Lap 4/56: Norris is sandwiched between the two Ferraris, but Hamilton is bidding to change that up by having a go at Norris. 8.10pm BST Lap 3/56: Norris has a run at Leclerc. Maybe a bit impatient? Leclerc has the soft tires and may be able to stay ahead for that reason. 8.08pm BST Lap 2/56: DRS, which helps drivers overtake, is only in effect is a driver is within a second of the preceding car. Verstappen already has more than 1.5 seconds on everyone. Albon apparently bumped into Bortoleto in that start and got the worst of it. 8.07pm BST Lap 1/56: Yellow flag waves briefly but is put away. Albon had a horrific start and is well back. Verstappen is just pulling away already. Russell has dropped two spots behind Hamilton and Piastri. Tsunoda is up three and is three ahead of arch-rival Lawson. 8.05pm BST Lights out Verstappen zips out quickly but slows down a bit, Norris gets caught behind him, and Leclerc (who won here last year) charges past him in to second. 8.01pm BST Formation lap is underway. Get your popcorn … 7.59pm BST Tire choices: Medium tires all around except for Leclerc (3rd on the grid, soft) and the last five on the grid – Bortoleto soft, Ocon hard, Albon hard, Stroll soft, Hadjar hard. Interesting strategic choice by Ferrari to put their two drivers on different tires. How soon will Leclerc come in for a change? The race is 56 laps. 7.56pm BST Current standings and storylines 1. Piastri, 3362. Norris, 3143. Verstappen, 2814. Russell, 2445. Leclerc, 1776. Hamilton, 130Topic A is obviously Verstappen’s march toward a fifth straight championship (call it four if you believe Hamilton was robbed in 2021) that seemed utterly impossible a few weeks ago. Topic A1 is whether the McLaren duo of Piastri and Norris can stay out of each other’s way. Other stories to follow: - Yuki Tsunoda was quite aggravated with Liam Lawson yesterday, claiming that the young driver from New Zealand was hindering his qualifying efforts. Frustration over the radio isn’t unusual, but given that Tsunoda and Lawson may be battling to keep their jobs in the Red Bull/Racing Bulls organization next year, we can’t write it off as an isolated incident. They’ll also be starting in close proximity – Lawson 12th, Tsunoda 13th. - In the unlikely event of a Verstappen collapse, could Russell charge into the top three by season’s end? - Have the Ferraris of Leclerc and Hamilton turned the corner? Hamilton, the six-time world champion among the best ever in the sport, has yet to reach the podium with the team he joined this year. 7.38pm BST Brundle notes that the drivers aren’t on the grid right now because it’s too hot. It’s Texas, after all. 7.36pm BST Martin Brundle is doing his grid walk alongside Glen Powell, an actor who’ll be on Saturday Night Live next month. (I don’t watch a lot of movies.) While Brundle usually chats with team personnel and celebrities, he’s spending most of this walk explaining tire strategy to Powell, who interjects to note that a lot of Europeans are wearing cowboy hats, which makes him happy. 7.34pm BST The grid 1. Max Verstappen (Red Bull)2. Lando Norris (McLaren)3. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari)4. George Russell (Mercedes)5. Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari)6. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)7. Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes)8.

Isack Hadjar (Racing Bulls) Stroll is serving a five-place grid penalty but was spared the indignity of starting last when Hadjar crossed in qualifying. 7.28pm BST TV coverage is now showing how things look from the 251-foot tower overlooking the track. We’re told that the wind is so strong that the tower is moving, which makes me wonder how quickly I could run down 419 steps. 7.22pm BST Preamble The question I’ve been pondering today – if Max Verstappen overhauls both McLaren drivers (Oscar Piastri, Lando Norris), it would be the biggest comeback / worst collapse since …? Share your suggestions by emailing me at the link above. In the meantime, since we’re in Austin, and we’ll be seeing hyperefficient tire changes on pit road, let’s take a minute to remember this hyperefficient guitar change by one of Austin’s favorite sons, the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan. Stevie Ray Vaughan and a roadie show off their exemplary teamwork. 7.16pm BST Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s a look back at yesterday’s qualifying.

Matthew Stafford’s five touchdown passes for the Rams has to be the outstanding performance of the day. To do it without his star receiver in Puka Nacua makes it even more impressive. The QB ended up finding 10 different pass catchers in Nacua’s absence. True offensive wizardry from Sean McVay, these Rams will be eyeing the postseason. Goodnight! Updated at 9.31pm BST 9.16pm BST Full time Chicago Bears 26-14 New Orleans Saints Cleveland Browns 31-6 Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs 31-0 Las Vegas Raiders Minnesota Vikings 22-28 Philadelphia Eagles New York Jets 6-13 Carolina Panthers Tennessee Titans 13-31 New England Patriots In the final game the Jets stay winless at 0-7 and the Panthers have a winning record (what?!) at 4-3. I believe I said earlier the Panthers wouldn’t need to score again when they went 10-3 up, and here I am stating the obvious while pretending I have insight. Poor Jets fans. 9.10pm BST Final score: Vikings 22-28 Eagles Hurts leads Philadelphia to a hard-fought win over Minnesota. His final stat line reads 19/23 for 326 yards, three TDs and no picks. A perfect game. The Vikings will feel they could have won this one as two early interceptions took their toll but the Eagles defense did enough to keep the enemy out of the endzone and limit them to field goals. Eagles are back soaring at 5-2 and Vikes are 3-3. Updated at 9.12pm BST 9.05pm BST Final scores: Bears 26-14 Saints, Browns 31-6 Dolphins Easy, easy wins for the 4-2 Bears and 2-5 Browns. Tough losses for the 1-6 Saints and 1-6 Dolphins. Miami really struggling now. 9.03pm BST Vikings 22-28 Eagles 1:34, 4th quarter Bold call from Philadelphia to go for the pass on 2nd and 9. They miss and on 3rd down head coach Nick Sirianni just calls the timeout before they take a delay of game penalty. Phew. Hurts hurls it waaaaay downfield to Brown and the pass is on. the. money. A first down and a 45-yard strike. The QB has his first 300+-yard passing game for over a year. They are in range for a game-ending field goal. 8.58pm BST Vikings 22-28 Eagles 1:57, 4th quarter It’s good! After going for it on 4th down and getting it to force a 1st and goal the Vikings are rocked back by a sack from Josh Uche. They have to settle for another field goal in the red zone. Reichard fantasy owners are thrilled by 29-yard chip shot. Updated at 8.58pm BST 8.55pm BST Final score: Titans 13-31 Patriots Tennessee don’t get the new manager bounce from head coach Mike McCoy as Drake Maye continues his commendable rise at quarterback for New England. Pats are 5-2 and Titans 1-6. Updated at 8.59pm BST 8.51pm BST Vikings 19-28 Eagles 2:58, 4th quarter Wentz is putting Minnesota on his back right now with two scrambles for first downs. The Vikings are on Philadelphia’s 23-yard line after dashes of 16 and 12 yards. On third down Wentz drops back and hurls one at TJ Hockenson in the endzone. The tight end makes a spectacular dive and catch and the touchdown is signalled. But we go to the review and it is reversed as he bobbled it into the ground. Unlucky TJ, what an amazing effort. And the horrible phrase “he did not survive the ground” rears its ugly head. Honestly has a more clunky phrase ever ben conceived? Updated at 8.52pm BST 8.46pm BST Final score: Chiefs 31-0 Raiders Well that was easy. The Chiefs rise to 4-3 and the Raiders slump to 2-5. 8.37pm BST TOUCHDOWN Vikings 19-28 Eagles 6:35, 4th quarter Instant validation from Greg Olsen on comms: “this is Jalen Hurts’ best game in a long time”. And he is firing on all cylinders. A completion to a wide open Smith for 21 yards is followed up a perfect leading pass to Brown as he runs through the middle for a 26-yard score. Hurts now has three touchdown tosses on the day. The Vikings need one of their own and quickly. Updated at 8.38pm BST 8.33pm BST Vikings 19-21 Eagles 9:16, 4th quarter Quarterback Hurts is dancing in the pocket as he evades pressure to extend the play, he rolls to his right and guns it at AJ Brown on the sideline for a 13-yard catch and first down on 3rd and long. Hurts’ best game this season by a mile as he sits on 16/19 and 234 yards, two touchdowns and no picks. 153.1 QBR. 8.31pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Browns 31-6 Dolphins 10:56, 4th quarter First points away from the big game in Minnesota for a while as Judkins hits the hat-trick of scores for Cleveland from two yards out. Why on Earth did I bench him in fantasy? Ah yes, because I know nothing! 8.27pm BST Vikings 19-21 Eagles 10:35, 4th quarter Its good! Wentz is sacked on 3rd and 5 as he holds on to the ball far too long. The Eagles get their first sack of the day at a crucial moment. Reichard knocks down another from 35 yards to draw even closer to the Eagles. Not close enough yet, again a disappointing misfire. The Vikings have been the better team but trail. 8.23pm BST It’s NO good! Vikings 16-21 Eagles 13:33, 4th quarter Well the Vikes do limit the Eagles to a field goal try but Jake Elliott misses his first of the season from 42 yards. Oh lord! If you believe in momentum this swing could be HUGE! Wentz comes out and finds receiver Jordan Addison for a nice 25-yard gain and another for 20 yards to take Minnesota deep into Eagles territory. Wow. 8.19pm BST The witching hour It’s almost Halloween after all, your scores as we roll into the final quarter. And it is grim reading for a fans of a few of these teams. Chicago Bears 23-14 New Orleans Saints Cleveland Browns 24-6 Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs 31-0 Las Vegas Raiders Minnesota Vikings 16-21 Philadelphia Eagles New York Jets 3-13 Carolina Panthers Tennessee Titans 13-31 New England Patriots The Vikings need to try and limit the Eagles to a field goal in Minnesota to keep it to one score. 8.16pm BST Vikings 16-21 Eagles 15:00, 4th quarter Philadelphia come out and show they can still run a passing attack. On 3rd and 15 they convert their first third down of the day as Jalen Hurts to Smith for 28 yards then finds him again for 19. The Eagles are knocking on the door in enemy territory with 28 yards still to travel. All aboard! 8.10pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 16-21 Eagles 3:38, 3rd quarter Jordan Mason takes a direct snap on the wildcat and just, and I mean just, breaks the plane of the goalline from one-yard out. He reaches out, as Greg Olsen informs us this is complete no-no, but doesn’t fumble and he finds the score. Great playcalling to make the Eagles blink and keep pace with the Super Bowl champions. Updated at 8.11pm BST 8.00pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Bears 14-20 Saints 9:40, 3rd quarter Spencer Rattler finds his man again as receiver Chris Olave grabs his second touchdown of the day from 14 yards. They have a good thing going here and Chicago fans will be slightly annoyed by me talking up the Bears moving to 4-2 earlier. 7.57pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 9-21 Eagles 8:07, 3rd quarter Devonta Smith turns on the jets and destroys the Vikings secondary with a 79-yard touchdown catch. Great to see the Eagles getting Smith and Brown in the game and reaping the reward. Throw the ball to your best players and they will do the rest. 7.54pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Titans 10-31 Patriots 7:20, 3rd quarter Make that a horrific start for the Titans too. K’Lavon Chaisson follows up his sack in the first half with a fumble recovery turned into a touchdown. The four-yard scoop and score coming after Titans QB Cam Ward was sacked. 7.50pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Browns 24-6 Dolphins 14:48, 3rd quarter TOUCHDOWN! Titans 10-24 Patriots 7:29, 3rd quarter Horrific start for the Dolphins as Tua throws a pick six on the opening play of the half. Tyson Campbell runs it back for a 34-yard touchdown. Cleveland are laughing. Drake Maye is back in the game for New England and leads his team inside the 10-yard line. Rhamondre Stevenson then follows up with a four-yard touchdown run. 7.47pm BST Vikings 9-14 Eagles 9:46, 3rd quarter It’s good! Wentz makes another boneheaded play and gets burnt for intentional grounding in the red zone. Why oh why wouldn’t he just throw it to the wide open receiver on his left rather than just toss it two yards into the dirt straight ahead of him. Greg Olsen has never sounded so annoyed in the commentary box. The Vikings have to settle for the field goal from Reichard from 28 yards. They might regret these flubs. 7.43pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs 28-0 Raiders 9:00, 3rd quarter Running back Isiah Pacheco scampers in from seven yards out to keep piling the misery on the miserable Las Vegas Raiders. 7.41pm BST Titans 13-17 Patriots 11:00, 3rd quarter A nervous wait for Patriot fans as quatyerback Drake Maye is being evalutated on the sidelines for a concussion after being bounced off the turf head first. He had the Pats rolling but back-up Josh Dobbs fires them into the red zone with a 12-yard pass to Demario Douglas. 7.31pm BST Half-time Chicago Bears 20-7 New Orleans Saints Cleveland Browns 17-6 Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs 21-0 Las Vegas Raiders Minnesota Vikings 6-14 Philadelphia Eagles New York Jets 3-10 Carolina Panthers Tennessee Titans 13-17 New England Patriots TOUCHDOWN in Chicago as Spencer Rattler hits Chris Olave for a 57-yard bomb then follows it up with a 21-yard score. Comeback is on. Updated at 7.33pm BST 7.26pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jets 3-10 Panthers 2:30, 2nd quarter Bryce Young slings a short three-yard pass to Xavier Legette to put Carolina ahead. Could be enough for the Panthers to take this one with back-up QB Tyrod Taylor taking over for the Jets. 7.22pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Bears 20-0 Saints 4:35, 2nd quarter TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs 21-0 Raiders, half-time Almost identical scores in these ones, but the same storyline developing. Absolute thrashings. Running back Kyle Monangai bangs in from the one-yard line for the Bears while Rashee Rice catches his second touchdown of the day from three yards. Oh and by the way this is Rice’s first game of the season after serving a six-game suspension. Looks like the Chiefs are going back to the Super Bowl then, they had you fooled at 0-2, didn’t they. Updated at 7.23pm BST 7.17pm BST Vikings 6-14 Eagles 2:00, 2nd quarter Minnesota’s defense are fighting back as they force Philadelphia to punt after an impressive sack from former Eagle Eric Wilson. Wentz moves the Vikings to midfield at the two-minute buzzer. Delicately poised. 7.06pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Browns 17-3 Dolphins 5:10, 2nd quarter Quinshon Judkins is having a day! The rookie running back bags his second touchdown from three yards and already has amassed 77 yards. The Dolphins cannot stop him. Updated at 7.07pm BST 7.04pm BST Vikings 6-14 Eagles 6:34, 2nd quarter It’s good! Wentz sharpens up with a bomb to Justin Jefferson for 40 yards then edges them to within seven of the goalline. Jefferson goes up for a perfectly thrown ball in the endzeone and it looks good but he drops it after Cooper DeJean punches the ball out with a glancing blow. On 4th and 1 the Vikings go for it and get the touchdown but a holding penalty chalks off the score. They are forced to kick the field goal and Will Reichard makes it from 34 yards, disappointing. 6.59pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Bears 13-0 Saints 9:05, 2nd quarter D’Andre Swift smashes home an 11-yard run to give Chicago a juicy lead at home. After losing their first two games the Bears are eyeing 4-2, what a turnaround! 6.56pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Titans 10-10 Patriots 5:34, 1st quarter Patriots QB Drake Maye and tight end Austin Hooper hook up for a three-yard touchdown to finish a whopping 93-yard drive. Maye looking good but can the defense match him and stop the dismal Titans? 6.52pm BST Vikings 3-14 Eagles 12:02, 2nd quarter Carson Wentz is really struggling now as he follows the pick six up with another interception. On 2nd and forever he uncorks a bomb only for safety Andrew Makuba to steal it for the Eagles. Ouch. Updated at 6.52pm BST 6.48pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs 14-0 Raiders 9:17, 2nd quarter Hollywood Brown grabs an eight-yard strike from Patrick Mahomes as the Chiefs already feel out of sight in this one. 6.44pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 3-14 Eagles 13:26, 2nd quarter Oooh that is a shocker from Carson Wentz. The quarterback steps back and an on-rushing defender blocks out Jalyx Hunt from view. As he throws the linebacker is waiting patiently for an easy catch and he runs it back for 42 yards and the easiest of pick sixes. 6.39pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Titans 10-3 Patriots Tennessee retake the lead, fourth-round Chimere Dike getting the touchdown. Elsewhere, Cleveland and Miami have exchanged field goals in an unsurprisingly cagey first quarter. 6.28pm BST Adams' Wembley hat-trick for Rams sinks Jaguars Davante Adams scored a hat-trick of touchdowns as Los Angeles Rams clinched a convincing 35-7 NFL victory over Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw five touchdown passes, the first two – to Konata Mumpfield and Adams – helping the Rams establish a 14-0 lead after the first quarter. Their dominance continued as the Jaguars were punished for a third time when Stafford again found Adams from close range. The third quarter remained scoreless but the Rams put the game to bed at the start of the fourth, Stafford picking up his fourth passing touchdown of the contest when he threw for 31 yards to Terrance Ferguson. Jaguars avoided the blank, getting on the scoreboard through rookie Travis Hunter, but the Rams had the final word as Stafford again found Adams to cap a brilliant display, earning the Rams their fifth win of the season and inflicting a second straight loss on the Jaguars. PA Media 6.22pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs 7-0 Raiders And last season’s other Super Bowl team are also on the board, Rashee Rice running it in from close range. Elsewhere, the Patriots have levelled at 3-3 in Tennessee, while the Bears and Panthers are both up by a field goal. 6.20pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 0-7 Eagles Philadelphia lead! It’s a 37-yard touchdown for AJ Brown, his first of the season. 6.10pm BST Titans 3-0 Patriots The first points are on the board in Nashville, with the Titans – under interim coach Mike McCoy – kicking an early field goal. 6.02pm BST Here are the games starting at 12pm CST/1pm EST/6pm BST (home teams listed first): (3-2) Chicago Bears v New Orleans Saints (1-5)(1-5) Cleveland Browns v Miami Dolphins (1-5)(3-3) Kansas City Chiefs v Las Vegas Raiders (2-4)(3-2) Minnesota Vikings v Philadelphia Eagles (4-2)(0-6) New York Jets v Carolina Panthers (3-3)(1-5) Tennessee Titans v New England Patriots (4-2) 5.53pm BST Full time: Jaguars 7-35 Rams Lawrence drags the offense inside the 20-yard line and the tipped pass almost makes it into Dyami Brown’s hands in the endzone but he is just that little bit too far away. A fourth turnover on downs for Lawrence. And that is all she wrote as the Rams will kneel on it to see this one out. Stafford has been sublime and really shown up Lawrence’s errant passing but 13 penalties and many dropped catches are equally to blame for this shocker from Jacksonville. They were just never in the fight after slipping to 14-0 down in the first quarter. Sean McVay will be delighted with his team moving up to 5-2 while the Jaguars slip to 4-3 after a second successive defeat, they also drop to 7-7 on games played in London. Updated at 7.35pm BST 5.42pm BST Jaguars 7-35 Rams 3:56 4th quarter Bad to worse for Jacksonville and Brian Thomas Jr. The receiver shuffles off the field with an injury after making three catches on seven targets for 31 yards. Oh and a 13th penalty of the day quickly follows. The Rams have gained almost 30 more yards from Jags penalties than they have rushing: 119 yards plays 92. Updated at 7.35pm BST 5.34pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jaguars 7-35 Rams 4:58, 4th quarter Adams the hat-trick hero! But first the Jags rack up 12 penalties after another pair of silly mistakes. The first is a bit of brain fade. On what would have been an incompletion on third down, Jourdan Lewis interferes with Davante Adams. Next, again on third down, Gardeck roughs up Stafford to gift 1st and goal on the one-yard line. The QB rolls out and hits Adams for an identical score as the first. He goes one-on-one with Montaric Brown and there is only one winner. What a day for Stafford. Five touchdowns thrown. Updated at 7.35pm BST 5.21pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jaguars 7-28 Rams 9:06, 4th quarter Good news! Rookie Travis Hunter grabs his first NFL touchdown. He streaks down field on a corner route deep into the right side of the field, he then cuts back to his left with a swish of his hips and is home for the 34-yard score! Hope is lost in this one but that is promising for the future of this young offense. The drive was set up by another couple of chunk plays from Lawrence to Hunter and Washington. Updated at 5.41pm BST 5.13pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jaguars 0-28 Rams 11:19, 4th quarter Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. This is getting embarrassing now. The Jags force another three and out from Stafford with a huge sack, until they don’t. A defensive holding penalty gifts a first down then the Rams seem content to run out the clock until an incompletion brings out the McVay doesn’t trust his kicker alarm! Poor Joss Karty. What did he do to deserve this. The Rams go for it on 4th down, well sort of. Stafford catches the Jags in the neutral zone before the snap and it is now just 4th and inches. And they call a naked bootleg instead of the run, Stafford rolls out to his left and goes for the home run shot to Terrance Ferguson. The rookie tight end is wide open in the endzone and he catches his first career touchdown for 31 yards. A perfect throw from Stafford. Two penalties gift LA the touchdown. Updated at 5.22pm BST 5.02pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 0:27, 3rd quarter This game has completely stalled. The Rams go three and out now. Since the third LA touchdown this is the game sequence: turnover on downs, kneel, punt, downs, punt, downs, punt, punt, punt. Nine possessions without a single point scored, grim. Meanwhile former QB and colour commentator Kurt Warner points out that the Jags could be only 21-9 down if they had made field goals rather than trying and failing on fourth downs. I take his point but offer that being 21-9 down is still a giant deficit when they are stalling so badly on approach to the endzone. Oh and another punt from the Jags, make that 10 possessions. The Rams stellar defense going well for a third game this season not allowing an opponent score a TD. Updated at 5.37pm BST 4.54pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 2:33, 3rd quarter A good 17-yard kick return and the Jags are instantly bumped into Rams territory thanks to a face mask penalty on Ty Hamilton. 35 to go. Oh dear, what is it about this territory for Jacksonville? An unblocked Quentin Lake storms straight at Lawrence and the QB doesn’t get the ball out. The Jags are shoved back to the 48-yard line. Punt. Updated at 4.54pm BST 4.48pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 4:42, 3rd quarter Stafford pitches a quick three and out as the Jaguars defense maintain their excellent start to the second half. Jacksonville have had ample opportunity to respond and still have plenty of time on the clock. Can Lawrence and his receivers find some rhythm? Updated at 4.49pm BST 4.45pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 5:34, 3rd quarter Another drive for the Jags, another drop from Brian Thomas. Jacksonville are knocking on the red zone after a 38-yard strike to Dyami Brown. Thomas goes up in the elevator has the ball in his hands and lets it go again on 2nd and 7. A missed pass to Hunter then sets up a 4th down. Another incompletion turns it over on downs with Lawrence under extreme pressure. QB is below 50% in completed passes with 15/32 for 185 yard with a rating of 65. Updated at 4.46pm BST 4.34pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 8:10, 3rd quarter Another Jags penalty for illegal contact puts the Rams on midfield. Hunter then pops up on defense for Jacksonville. The rookie makes a huge play on Davante Adams of all people on 3rd down to stop the Rams in their tracks on a perfectly thrown deep pass from Stafford. More Hunter on defense might be a good idea. No rest for the rook as the offense need him now. Updated at 4.34pm BST 4.27pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 10:38, 3rd quarter LA’s turn to get sloppy. Kam Curl is penalised for defensive holding on Hunter. Jags have 38 yards to go for a vital touchdown. Hunter then makes another catch for eight yards and on 3 and 2 Lawrence sails an easy throw way, way over Johnny Mundt’s head. They go for it and Lawrence fires another fastball off Dyami Brown’s outstretched hand. That poor start is really starting to bite as the Jaguars shouldn’t have to be taking these kinds of risks. That said Lawrence just killed the drive with a missed bread-and-butter throw. Updated at 4.27pm BST 4.21pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 11:39, 3rd quarter Travis Hunter is getting going now. Lawrence finds the rookie for back-to-back gains of 11 yards to move the Jags to midfield. Darious Williams then commits pass interference for the Rams for an instant first down as he drags Washington’s head back while swatting the ball down. 4.14pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 14:16, 3rd quarter Matthew Stafford rolls out with the Rams offense and goes three and out. Nice work from the Jags defense to hold up their end of the bargain. Almost forced an interception too but the pair of defenders juggle the ball inches off the ground and fail to reel it in. C’mon Trevor, I want to believe. Let’s have it. 4.10pm BST In this period of quiet we can take a look at the early slate up next: Chicago Bears v New Orleans Saints Cleveland Browns v Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs v Las Vegas Raiders Minnesota Vikings v Philadelphia Eagles New York Jets v Carolina Panthers Tennessee Titans v New England Patriots A few decent ones in there, the one jumping out to me is Vikings v Eagles. Can Philadelphia stop the slide? Updated at 4.11pm BST 4.00pm BST Half-time! Jaguars 0-21 Rams The Rams are content to sit on the lead and let the clock run down. Confidence is everything but confident they deserve to be. For Jacksonville as Willy Shakespeare didn’t say “a Jaguar doth not change his spots”. It is same old, same old for Lawrence and company. Mistakes have gifted LA great field position and limited the offense. The quarterback is missing throws and when he has made them his receivers are letting him down. A bad day at the offense. Updated at 4.26pm BST 3.52pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 1:28, 2nd quarter Lawrence guns it too wide for Hunter and the ball glances off the rookie’s glove for an incompletion on 3rd and 7. 4th down and we are going for it now after declining earlier. Dangerous considering the Jags might give the ball back to Stafford twice as the Rams will receive the second half kick-off. Lawrence tucks and runs and … is … short. Three yards short. The Rams get the ball back with two timeouts. Updated at 3.52pm BST 3.48pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 2:00, 2nd quarter Lawrence finds Thomas up the sideline for 24 yards then keeps the chains moving with some nice mid-range work. First trip to the Rams red zone and the Jaguars dial up the trick play on 2nd and 6. LA are not fooled and Hunter’s scramble is stopped on the line of scrimmage. Key third down coming. 3.44pm BST Jaguars 0-21 Rams 3:34, 2nd quarter Lawrence comes out and slings a quick throw out wide straight into the dirt. Strange. Another misfire follows it as a wide open Washington steps out of bounds to cancel out a much-improved long pass. Lawrence calls the time out on third and long. In this down time Adams snatching a pair of TDs has me jealous as Nacua is languishing on my fantasy bench this week. Anyone have any start/sit propositions they want to throw my way? I promise I will win you your matchup this week. Updated at 3.44pm BST 3.37pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jaguars 0-21 Rams 4:37, 2nd quarter If you make a mistake at least try and learn from it. The Jaguars commit another needless pass interference penalty on an incomplete pass from Stafford moving them into midfield. A wide open Adams then moves the ball 16 yards into the red zone and Colby Parkinson thinks he has scored until he is politely told he was down on the one-yard line. Adams makes a stunning one-handed grab for a one-yard touchdown. Stafford is on fire: 15/20, 127 yards, 3 touchdowns. Updated at 4.27pm BST 3.30pm BST Jaguars 0-14 Rams 7:11, 2nd quarter It’s NO good! The drive starts well with Lawrence shaking off some rust. He scans the field and finds Tim Patrick for a 22-yard strike. The Jags march into Rams territory. A touchdown would be very useful here. And as I finish typing Lawrence throws a perfect fast ball on 3rd and 2 at his star wideout Brian Thomas. The ball goes straight through his his hands. Kicker Cam Little steps up for the 50-yarder and misses. Thomas will be kicking himself for taking his eye off the ball. Updated at 3.31pm BST 3.23pm BST Jaguars 0-14 Rams 9:59, 2nd quarter Jacksonville’s defense shows up. Stafford goes three and out with airtight coverage from the Jags defensive backs. And on the punt, more bad luck. Parker Washington returns it for the TOUCHDOWN but an illegal block above the waist by Jarrian Jones chalks it off. The pundits say bad call as the block does not affect the play. Not sure I agree but then Suh chimes in with “if you play football then you know it” so that’s me instantly put in my place. Definitely a bad call. Boo refs, boo. Updated at 3.24pm BST 3.15pm BST Jaguars 0-14 Rams 11:18, 2nd quarter A third sack (already) rocks Lawrence to the turf and a failed run puts the ball back in Lawrence’s hands at 3rd and 13. The QB and his young receiver Hunter are not on the same page though and the ball sails by him. Punt. 3.13pm BST Jaguars 0-14 Rams 12:38, 2nd quarter Jacksonville smartly are turning to the run and get to midfield with Travis Etienne churning away. LA respond and stop then to set up a 4th and 1. The Jags go for it and Parker Washington scampers for three yards on nifty little end around play. 3.08pm BST Jaguars 0-14 Rams 1:38, 1st quarter The tone has just been made clear for the Rams defense. They are here to bully Trevor Lawrence. Linebacker Byron Young chases the QB out of the pocket and shoves him out of bounds with a level of needless aggression verging on the comical. Updated at 3.08pm BST 3.02pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jaguars 0-14 Rams 1:51, 1st quarter Boom! Xavier Smith logs the seventh different receiver hit by Stafford already today. A short run from Blake Corum then sets up a 1st and goal. Adams then beats his man on the goalline, Stafford tosses it up and the veteran brings it down for the score. So very easy and the Jacksonville defense is really struggling. What an incredible start for the Rams. Updated at 3.04pm BST 2.59pm BST Jaguars 0-7 Rams 3:25, 1st quarter The Rams are back in Jaguars territory in the blink of an eye thanks to a 26-yard pass interference penalty and a 23-yard strike to tight end Colby Parkinson. Then Adams makes his first catch of the day to move Los Angeles back into the red zone on the 15-yard line. Updated at 3.03pm BST 2.57pm BST Jaguars 0-7 Rams 4:53, 1st quarter Apparently Ndamukong Suh, in the studio for Sky Sports, is an Arsenal fan. Did have a bit of Patrick Vieira about him, didn’t he? Updated at 3.03pm BST 2.54pm BST Jaguars 0-7 Rams 5:12, 1st quarter Offensive holding pushes the Jaguars back 10 yards, tough start to their riposte. A great knock down by Kobie Turner on the line of scrimmage forces 3rd and 14 and Lawrence ovethrows Travis Hunter. Three and out again. A 1min 27sec drive followed by a 1min 20sec effort is certainly going to keep those Rams linebackers fresh. Updated at 3.03pm BST 2.49pm BST TOUCHDOWN! Jaguars 0-7 Rams 7:01, 1st quarter No Nacua, no problem. Stafford uses five different receivers on the first drive finishing with rookie Konata Mumpfield (who?) for a five-yard score. It is only his second catch in his young career. Excellent work to finish that under pressure after going for it on 4th and 3. Updated at 4.28pm BST 2.45pm BST Jaguars 0-0 Rams 7:01, 1st quarter The Rams are on and in Nacua’s absence Davante Adams is targeted but overthrown on the opening play. Tight end Tyler Higbee then finds the first down with an easy short pass out Stafford’s right. A nice mix of run and pass in the rain finds another couple of first downs with the tight ends featuring. Higbee in particular is keeping this drive moving with a couple of great grabs with what looks like more of a bar of soap than a ball. And here we go, McVay does not trust his kicker alert. 4th and 3 on the 16-yard line and the Rams go for it. And they get it thanks to running back Kyren Williams making the grab. Updated at 2.45pm BST 2.35pm BST Jaguars 0-0 Rams 14:03, 1st quarter Here we go! Lawrence and the Jaguars offense take the field for the opening drive. First play and Verse sacks the QB. Told you the pass rush was good. Not the start Jacksonville were looking for. Three and out. Punt. Updated at 2.39pm BST 2.28pm BST Preamble Hi and hello football fans, week seven of N-F-L is upon us and has brought with it that rarest of treats: a game between two teams (two!) with winning records in London! The 4-2 Jacksonville Jaguars host the 4-2 LA Rams at their home away from home in Wembley. This is very much cause for celebration as at 2.30pm in the UK and the earliest of mornings for fans in Los Angeles at 6.30am we have a shot at closing out this year’s London series with a cracker. England’s capital has been graced only once before with a matchup between two “good” teams when the Giants and Packers, both 3-1, came to party in 2022. Yes it only took 15 years of slop to finally receive a blessing in Daniel Jones vanquishing Aaron Rodgers 27-22 with a fierce second-half comeback after trailing 17-3. The G-men would go on to make the playoffs so are either the Rams or Jaguars heading in that direction? Both are well positioned with LA in a three-way tie at the top of the NFC West and Jacksonville one game back from Jones’ Indianapolis Colts in the AFC South. It is a little early to start projecting for the postseason however so let’s take a look at today’s matchup. The big team news is the Rams are missing the great Puka Nacua at wide receiver and the Jaguars are without star linebacker Devin Lloyd. On the field the story so far for both teams has been one of successes let down by inconsistency. For LA the kicking game has been a problem while the offense, led by quarterback Matthew Stafford, has been one of the most productive in terms of yards and success rate across the league but are 24th in red zone efficiency scoring a touchdown only 50% of the time they get inside the 20-yard line. Watch out for head coach, Sean McVay, digging into his box of tricks to throw the Jaguars lots of different looks as the Rams aim to break the 30-point mark for the first time this season (second if you count the Titans). On defense LA are much more solid and have not allowed teams to score a single touchdown twice this season. The men the Jaguars need to be most wary of are the best pass-rushing duo in football Jared Verse and Braden Fiske. The game could be won and lost with how well Jacksonville protect their quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Or they could try and get the running game going again to nullify the pressure on him after struggling against the Seahawks. Jags fans will hope the Lawrence who took down the Chiefs shows up today."
3,Israel says it has resumed enforcement of ceasefire after wave of airstrikes on Gaza – Middle East crisis live,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/19/gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-rafah-hostages-middle-east-crisis-live-news-updates,World news,2025-10-19 20:30:37,"Marina Dunbar (now), Morgan Ofori and Matthew Pearce (earlier)","9.28pm BST The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) is denouncing Israel for launching airstrikes on Gaza despite a shaky ceasefire. “Since the start of the ceasefire, the Netanyahu regime has been itching to fully restart the genocide in Gaza,” Cair said in a statement. “The cruel and unnecessary mass bombing of civilians across Gaza constitutes a blatant violation of President Trump’s ceasefire agreement and a resumption of the genocide. President Trump must rein in the Israeli occupation forces and stop sending American weapons and American taxpayer dollars to fund Israel’s war machine.” Updated at 9.30pm BST 8.52pm BST Gaza’s civil defence agency and hospitals said a series of Israeli airstrikes across the territory killed at least 45 people on Sunday, updating an earlier toll of 33, according to AFP. The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip, as Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the nine-day-old ceasefire brokered by Trump. “At least 45 people were killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes on various areas of the Gaza Strip,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesperson for the civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue service under Hamas authority, told AFP. Four hospitals in Gaza confirmed the death toll to AFP, saying they had received the dead and wounded. Earlier, Bassal detailed several of the strikes. He said six people were killed when an Israeli strike targeted a “group of civilians” in Zuwaida town in central Gaza. Six other people, including children, were killed and 13 others injured in two separate strikes near Nuseirat in central Gaza, Bassal said. A woman and two children were killed when a drone strike hit a tent housing displaced people near Asdaa City, north of Khan Younis. Two people, including a journalist, were killed and several others injured in an Israeli strike in the western part of Zuwaida. In another attack, two people were killed and several injured when an Israeli strike hit a tent in the Al-Ahli Club area in Nuseirat, Bassal said. Two more people were killed in an Israeli airstrike in eastern Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, he added. One individual was killed in a strike on an apartment in a building in western Gaza City, the civil defence agency said. The others succumbed later on Sunday to injuries incurred in these strikes, Bassal said. Updated at 9.00pm BST 8.09pm BST Here is some footage of the aftermath of airstrikes Israel carried out on Sunday in Gaza in response to the ceasefire “violations” it accused Hamas of committing. 7.38pm BST The Israeli military said it had begun resuming enforcement of the Gaza ceasefire after it says it was “violated” by Hamas, signaling an end to strikes on the territory that it said were carried out in response to earlier attacks on its forces on Sunday, Reuters reported. “In accordance with the directive of the political echelon, and following a series of significant strikes in response to Hamas’ violations, the IDF has begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire,” the military said in a statement. It adds: “The IDF will continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it.” Updated at 7.58pm BST 7.13pm BST Gaza’s civil defence agency said a series of Israeli airstrikes across the territory killed at least 33 people on Sunday, updating an earlier toll of 21. The Israeli military said it had struck dozens of Hamas targets across the Gaza Strip, as both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the nine-day-old ceasefire brokered by the US president, Donald Trump. Updated at 8.30pm BST 6.42pm BST The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced its first major test Sunday as an Israeli security official said the transfer of aid into the territory was halted “until further notice” after a Hamas ceasefire violation, and Israeli forces launched a wave of strikes, according to the Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement on the halt in aid, a little over a week since the start of the US-proposed ceasefire aimed at ending two years of war. Israel’s military earlier Sunday said its troops came under fire from Hamas militants in southern Gaza, and later said two soldiers were killed there. Israel’s military said then it struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets. Health officials said at least 29 Palestinians were killed across Gaza, including children. A senior Egyptian official involved in the ceasefire negotiations said “round-the-clock” contacts were under way to de-escalate the situation. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to speak to reporters. Updated at 6.53pm BST 6.18pm BST The Israeli military said two soldiers were killed in combat in southern Gaza on Sunday, as it carried out a series of strikes in the area, accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire, AFP reported. Major Yaniv Kula, 26, and staff sergeant Itay Yavetz, 21, “fell during combat in the southern Gaza Strip,” the military said, the first Israeli fatalities since the ceasefire took effect on October 10. 6.03pm BST Here are the latest photos coming through the wires after Israel launched strikes in the city of Khan Younis on the southern Gaza Strip. Updated at 6.03pm BST 5.12pm BST Israel halts supply of aid into Gaza Israel has closed its crossing points into Gaza to aid convoys, a security official told AFP on Sunday after the government accused Hamas of violating a ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire agreement had committed Israel to let in 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every day. It had halved the amount as it accused Hamas of violating the agreement by failing to return all the deceased hostages in time. It has so far also refused to reopen the key border crossing of Rafah, the only access point that is not exclusively controlled by Israel. A famine was declared in and around Gaza City by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) in August after a previous blockade of aid deliveries. Updated at 5.45pm BST 4.41pm BST IDF confirms it has begun ‘wave of attacks’ in southern Gaza The Israeli military says it has launched a wave of airstrikes on southern Gaza as the fragile ceasefire comes close to total collapse. The army said ‘massive and extensive wave of strikes’ were aimed at dozens of Hamas targets. In response to the blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement earlier today, the IDF (military) has begun a series of strikes against Hamas terror targets in the southern Gaza Strip,” it said in a statement. Updated at 4.42pm BST 3.58pm BST Afternoon summary The fragile Gaza ceasefire edged close to total collapse on Sunday amid renewed Israeli airstrikes across Gaza, including in the cities of Rafah and Beit Lahia, which killed and injured several Palestinians. Israel says the attacks were a response to Hamas gunfire and rocket-propelled grenade fire against its troops in Rafah. Hamas said that it was unaware of any incidents or clashes in Rafah, and accused Israel of a deliberate escalation. The events marked the biggest test yet of the US-brokered ceasefire. Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered “firm action” across Gaza in response to the clashes, meeting defence minister Israel Katz and intelligence chiefs to instruct strikes on “terror targets”. The IDF said its forces were dismantling tunnels and “eliminating threats” in Rafah, describing today’s violence as a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement. Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 11 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the territory on Sunday, including six in the north, as Israel said it may carry out further strikes after attacks on its troops in Rafah and Beit Lahia. Israel’s defence minister warned Hamas would “pay a heavy price” for any further ceasefire breaches, saying Israeli troops would respond “increasingly severely” if attacks continue. His comments come amid signs that parts of the Israeli government are losing patience with the truce. Hamas claimed to have located the body of another Israeli hostage, saying it intends to hand over the remains to Israel if “field conditions allow.” The group warned that continued airstrikes and shelling would make such transfers impossible. The IDF claim that Hamas withholding bodies of hostages violates the ceasefire agreement. Senior Israeli politicians have voiced growing scepticism about the ceasefire’s future. Hardline ministers Amichai Chikli and Avi Dichter said Israel cannot coexist with Hamas, while opposition leader Yair Golan urged a “decisive response,” accusing Netanyahu’s government of “failing to set new rules of the game.” Hamas dismissed a statement from the US state department that accused the group of planning an imminent attack in Gaza, calling the allegation “false” and “aligned with misleading Israeli propaganda.” The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will stay closed “until further notice”, Israel has said, after the Palestinian embassy in Cairo said the territory’s sole gateway to the outside world – and key to bringing aid into the destroyed territory – would reopen on Monday. 3.45pm BST Hamas rejects US claim of planned Gaza ceasefire violation as “Israeli propaganda” Hamas has dismissed a statement from the US state department that accused the group of planning an imminent attack in Gaza, calling the allegation “false” and “aligned with misleading Israeli propaganda.” In a statement on Sunday, Hamas said: “The US allegations are false and fully align with the misleading Israeli propaganda and provide cover for the continuation of the occupation’s crimes and organised aggression against our people in Gaza.” The comments came after the state department said late on Saturday it had obtained “credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.” The US warned that “should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,” without providing details of the alleged plan. Hamas rejected the accusation, calling on Washington to “stop repeating the occupation’s misleading narrative and focus on curbing its repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement.” The militant group said: “The facts on the ground reveal the exact opposite, as the occupation authorities are the ones who formed, armed, and funded criminal gangs that carried out killings, kidnappings, theft of aid trucks, and assaults against Palestinian civilians … confirming the occupation’s involvement in spreading chaos and disrupting security.” Updated at 3.46pm BST 3.38pm BST Gaza civil defence says at least 11 killed in Israeli strikes Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Sunday that at least 11 people were killed in a series of Israeli airstrikes across the territory, as both sides accused each other of breaching the ceasefire. Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for the agency, which operates under Hamas authority, said six people were killed when an Israeli strike hit a group of civilians in northern Gaza. The Israeli military told AFP it was checking reports of casualties. Earlier, a military official said Israel may carry out additional strikes after its forces targeted militants in Rafah and Beit Lahia, after three separate attacks on Israeli troops. 3.19pm BST Israeli military says further Gaza strikes possible An Israeli military official has said that more airstrikes could be carried out in Gaza, after attacks earlier in the day in Rafah in the south and Beit Lahia in the north, according to AFP. “There is a possibility for more strikes,” the official told reporters during an online briefing, after the army said it had targeted militants responsible for three separate attacks on Israeli forces. 3.09pm BST Iran executes man accused of spying for Israel Iran has executed a man convicted of spying for Israel’s intelligence agency, according to the country’s judiciary, in what officials described as the latest in a series of executions after the June war between Iran and Israel, AFP reports. The judiciary’s Mizan online news agency quoted Kazem Mousavi, the chief justice of Qom province, as saying: “The execution of this spy was carried out after confirmation by the supreme court and the rejection of his pardon request at Qom Prison.” The man, whose identity was not disclosed, was hanged on Saturday in the holy city of Qom, south of Tehran. Authorities said he had been in contact with Israeli intelligence since October 2023, was arrested early the following year, and had confessed to sharing confidential information online. Iran, which conducts executions by hanging, is the world’s second most prolific executioner after China, according to rights groups including Amnesty International. 3.00pm BST Israel warns Hamas will “pay a heavy price” for any ceasefire violations Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has warned that Israeli forces will respond forcefully if Hamas attacks troops in Gaza in breach of the ongoing ceasefire. “Hamas will pay a heavy price for every shot and every breach of the ceasefire,” Katz said in a statement. “If the message is not understood, our response will become increasingly severe.” 2.50pm BST Key event The Gaza health ministry has released photographs it says show “violations and signs of torture” on the bodies of Palestinians whose remains were recently returned by Israel. The graphic images, seen by the Guardian, show bodies with plastic restraints visible around their wrists, consistent with being bound before death. Photos depict prisoners who appear beaten, bruised and blindfolded, with fabric still wrapped tightly around the heads of some of the deceased. The release of the photographs follows earlier Guardian reporting in which Palestinians freed from Israeli prisons described severe mistreatment, including beatings, binding and exposure to extreme conditions during detention: Related: ‘Cruellest forms of torture’: freed Palestinians describe horrors of Israeli jail 2.30pm BST Hamas says it has located another hostage’s body, warns Israeli strikes could hinder handover Hamas’s armed wing says it has found the body of another Israeli hostage, which it plans to hand over to Israel on Sunday if “conditions allow,” according to Reuters. The group warned that any Israeli escalation could disrupt recovery efforts, after Israel confirmed it had carried out airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in southern Gaza amid renewed disputes over ceasefire violations. 2.22pm BST Thaslima Begum is an award-winning journalist with a focus on women, conflict and human rights With 97% of schools destroyed or damaged, 600,000 children have just begun their third year out of formal education.

Writing in his account, Fletcher described the scale of devastation as “staggering,” adding: “Nothing prepares you for Gaza – the scale of destruction, the density of loss, the quiet resilience in people’s eyes.” He said that despite the ceasefire, “every inch tells a story of loss … Gaza is a wasteland. Roads choked with rubble.” Fletcher, who has been coordinating aid convoys through Egypt, urged world leaders to keep the humanitarian lifeline open: “We owe it to those who have endured so much to move beyond the cycle of cruelty, terror and revenge.” 1.19pm BST Israeli politicians cast doubt on government’s commitment to ceasefire Following Israeli airstrikes on Gaza earlier today, more senior ministers have made remarks casting doubt on the government’s commitment to the ceasefire deal. Amichai Chikli, Israel’s diaspora affairs minister and a vocal hardliner, said: “As long as Hamas exists, there will be war.” Another cabinet member, Avi Dichter, described the situation as “difficult and complex”, accusing Hamas of violating the truce on the assumption that “Israel will not resume fighting.” He added: “The moment all the living hostages are in our hands, the conditions have changed. Israel will not give up on disarming Hamas.” From the opposition, Yair Golan, leader of the centre left Democrats party, also called for action, saying on social media: “Hamas’s attack in Gaza requires a decisive response. Only in this way are the rules of the game set.” 1.03pm BST Netanyahu orders ‘firm action’ in Gaza after attacks in Rafah Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed Israel’s security chiefs to “take firm action against terror targets in the Gaza Strip” after attacks in Rafah today. Netanyahu issued the order during a meeting with defence minister Israel Katz and the heads of the Shin Bet, the domestic security agency, and the Mossad (foreign intelligence), the office said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that Palestinian militants fired RPGs and sniper rounds at troops operating in the Rafah area of southern Gaza. In response, the IDF said it carried out a series of airstrikes on “terror targets” in the enclave. 12.44pm BST Israel army confirms air strikes in Rafah The IDF has issued a full statement on today’s attacks in Rafah: Earlier today, terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire toward IDF troops operating to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the Rafah area, in southern Gaza, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement.In response, the IDF has begun striking in the area to eliminate the threat and dismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity.These terrorist actions constitute a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement, and the IDF will respond firmly. The statement did not mention the reported attacks in Jabalia and other parts of southern Gaza. 12.24pm BST Freed Israeli hostage David Cunio received a hero’s welcome in the city of Yavne, where residents lined the streets waving Israeli and American flags as he was driven from hospital to rejoin his family, The Times of Israel reports. Cunio, who was abducted from kibbutz Nir Oz with his family during the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, leaned out of the car window to shake hands and thank supporters as music played and people applauded. His wife, Sharon Alony Cunio, and their twin daughters were released from captivity in November 2023 and have been living with her parents in Yavne since. 12.03pm BST Israel returns 15 Palestinian bodies to Gaza The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza says it has received the bodies of 15 deceased Palestinian prisoners released on Saturday by Israel through the International Committee of the Red Cross, bringing the total number of bodies returned to 150. In a statement, the ministry said its medical teams were following identification and examination procedures before handing the bodies over to families. The ministry added “that some of the bodies show signs of abuse”, including beatings, handcuffing and blindfolding. So far, the identities of 25 of the returned prisoners have been confirmed by relatives, according to the ministry.

Speaking on social media, Ben-Gvir said: “I call on the prime minister to order the IDF to fully resume combat in the Gaza Strip with maximum force. “The false illusions that Hamas will change its ways, or even adhere to the agreement it signed, are proving, as expected, to be dangerous to our security. “The Nazi terrorist organization must be completely destroyed – and the sooner, the better.” Ben-Gvir has past convictions for supporting terrorism.

Related: Reports of Israel airstrikes on Rafah as Gaza ceasefire deal comes under threat The Times of Israel reports that there was opposition to renaming the war from some hostages’ families and a few members of the cabinet. Speaking at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said: “At the end of two consecutive years of fighting, we remember how we began. We rose from the terrible disaster of 7 October.” He added that Israel would soon award military decorations to soldiers who fought in the campaign – a step traditionally marking the end of a war. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu left the meeting abruptly following news of the attacks across Gaza. Updated at 11.44am BST 11.24am BST Two Palestinians killed as Israel strikes northern Gaza city of Jabalia Israeli military airstrikes have also targeted areas in Jabalia, a city in northern Gaza, according to Israeli media, as attacks continue to escalate despite a week-old ceasefire. Local news agency Wafa reported that at least two Palestinians were killed and several others injured in a strike east of Jabalia. Emergency crews have been unable to reach the site after Israel designated the area a “high-risk zone.” The attacks come as prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu left a cabinet meeting to hold emergency security briefings, amid growing concern over the fragile truce. The strike is the latest in a series of Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement brokered by the US last week. 11.05am BST Senior Hamas official says group remain committed to the ceasefire Senior Hamas official Izzat Al Risheq has said that the Palestinian militant group remain committed to the ceasefire, which he accused Israel of repeatedly violating: “Hamas movement reaffirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement and emphasises that the Zionist occupation is the party continuing to violate the agreement and fabricate baseless pretexts to justify its crimes.” “Netanyahu’s attempts to evade and disavow his commitments come under pressure from his extremist terrorist coalition, in a bid to escape his responsibilities before the mediators and guarantors.” 10.40am BST Israel identifies latest returned body as former Thai hostage Israel have confirmed that the second of two bodies returned overnight by Hamas was that of a Thai farm worker, killed during the 7 October 2023 attack, whose body was taken to Gaza, AFP reports. Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the military had informed the family of the deceased hostage, Sonthaya Oakkharasri, that their loved one had been returned to Israel and formally identified. Updated at 10.58am BST 10.15am BST Israel launches fresh assault on Gaza, citing 'blatant violation' of ceasefire Israel have launched airstrikes in Rafah in southern Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian media report, as clashes flared between Israeli forces and Hamas despite a fragile US-brokered ceasefire. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan said the air force was striking targets in Rafah, while other outlets reported attacks elsewhere in southern Gaza and in the city of Jabalia in the north of the territory. Israeli TV network Channel 12 reported that the Rafah strikes were aimed at protecting members of the Yasser Abu Shabab militia – an Israeli-backed armed group accused by Palestinian sources of stealing humanitarian aid and attacking civilians during Israel’s two-year war on Gaza. The Palestinian outlet Quds Network, citing an unnamed security source, said a Hamas-led internal security unit had carried out an operation targeting a hideout belonging to the Yasser Abu Shabab group east of Rafah, shortly before the Israeli airstrikes began. According to The Times of Israel, “terror operatives in the Gaza Strip launched an attack on Israeli forces in Rafah,” prompting the strikes. The Israeli military said that Hamas militants have carried out “multiple attacks” against Israeli forces beyond the “yellow line” buffer zone, including a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire, calling it a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. Updated at 11.11am BST 9.47am BST Israel launches military attack on Gaza amid escalating tensions – reports Israel has launched an attack on Gaza, according to Israeli media, amid escalating tensions and mutual accusations with Hamas over breaches of the US-brokered ceasefire aimed at ending the war in the territory. There was no immediate comment from the military on the reported attack. Updated at 9.51am BST 9.42am BST Netanyahu says Rafah crossing to stay closed until Hamas returns bodies of hostages as ceasefire tensions rise The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed until further notice, Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said, adding its reopening will depend on Hamas handing over the bodies of deceased hostages as the two sides continued to trade blame over ceasefire violations. Hamas, in a statement late on Saturday, said Netanyahu’s decision to keep the crossing closed “constitutes a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a repudiation of the commitments he made to the mediators and guarantor parties.” As of Saturday evening, Hamas had handed back 12 of 28 deceased captives, saying it would need specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the rest from the ruins of Gaza. In key developments: Israel identified the body of a deceased hostage today, after Hamas handed over two bodies of what the militant group said are deceased hostages to the Red Cross late Saturday night. Late on Saturday, the US state department said it had received “credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.” Hamas has rejected the accusations, calling them “false” and blaming Israel for sponsoring “criminal gangs” responsible for killings, kidnappings and looting in Gaza. The group said its police forces were pursuing those responsible and urged Washington “to stop echoing the occupation’s misleading narrative”. Gaza’s media office has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire with Hamas 47 times since the truce came into effect in early October."
4,MPs urged to confront royal family over Prince Andrew’s Epstein links,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/19/mps-urged-to-confront-royal-family-over-prince-andrews-epstein-links,UK news,2025-10-19 20:28:13,"Eleni Courea, Alexandra Topping and Hannah Al-Othman","Parliament is under mounting pressure to examine what the royal family knew about Prince Andrew’s links to Jeffrey Epstein and introduce a mechanism to strip him of his titles. There were calls on Sunday night for Andrew to face a police investigation and for ancient rules barring parliament from freely scrutinising royals and formally removing their titles to be revisited. Related: Prince Andrew: are more revelations likely to emerge about scandal-hit royal? The Metropolitan police confirmed they were looking into claims that Andrew asked his Met bodyguard to dig up information on Virginia Giuffre, who had accused him of sexual assault, hours before the bombshell picture of them was published in 2011. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed his close protection officer Giuffre’s date of birth and confidential US social security number were “deeply concerning”. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.” The developing scandal forced Andrew to relinquish some of his royal titles on Friday, including Duke of York, having already lost the use of his HRH title after ceasing to be a “working royal”. He retains the dukedom, which would take an act of parliament to remove, while his status as a prince could only be removed if a letters patent were issued by the king. Andrew has vigorously denied any wrongdoing, and the FBI formally ended its investigation into his links to Epstein in July. But MPs and campaigners have called for further action including a Metropolitan police investigation into Andrew’s links to Epstein and an act of parliament to formally strip the prince of his titles. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, said she was writing to ministers this week to back her bill giving the king or a parliamentary committee the power to formally remove Andrew’s titles. “Every time this comes up, it clearly must be really traumatising for the victims and survivors, so it’s really important that this matter is dealt with once and for all,” Maskell said. “There are mechanisms which need to be put in place in order to remove a title.” Nadia Whittome, the Labour MP for Nottingham East, said: “It should be a given that the state removes Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s titles, rather than allowing him to hide behind voluntarily renouncing them and mealy-mouthed statements blaming his accusers.” Maskell proposed a removal of titles bill in 2022 which would enable the monarch or a parliamentary committee to remove titles in Andrew’s case and in the future. Similar legislation was enacted in 1917 to remove the titles of peers and princes who fought against the British in the first world war. One senior Labour backbencher and select committee chair described Andrew as a “disgrace” and said he “brings shame on himself and those associated with him”. “I would delight in voting for a parliamentary motion to strip him of all his titles,” they said. Asked by the BBC if he would support such legislation, Miliband said “the royal family will have to make its own decisions about what other steps can be taken” but that they had suggested “they didn’t want to take up parliamentary time with this”. Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, called for “a proper thorough investigation into what happened”. “It’s very clear the sense of entitlement that Prince Andrew has comes with being a prince and being part of the monarchy. The bigger story here is the monarchy itself. This is why I think the king has closed up shop. It poses some very difficult questions about how power operates in this country,” he said. George Foulkes, a Labour peer, wrote to the clerks of the Commons and Lords on Sunday night asking them to review rules restricting parliamentarians from asking questions about the royal family. Foulkes said that early this year, the Lords table office rejected questions he tried to ask on Andrew and his 10-year role as a UK special representative for trade and investment, which the prince finally gave up in 2011 after a string of controversies. “I wanted to ask questions about whether he had a security briefing, what his role was and a number of other things,” Foulkes said. “I was told by the table office that questions about the royal family were prohibited in both the Commons and the Lords.” Ultimately Foulkes was allowed to ask some specific questions about royal family expenditure, which parliament is allowed to question. Parliamentary rules state that “questions that cast reflections on the sovereign or the Royal Family” more broadly are inadmissible. On Sunday Foulkes called for the rules to be reviewed “in light of recent events”. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 letters were sent to MPs over the weekend urging them to push for a “full blown-parliamentary or independent inquiry into the royal Epstein scandal”. Supporters of the campaign group Republic wrote to their MPs accusing them of being complicit in their silence and urging them to call for an immediate investigation. Republic have called for an inquiry to look at actions taken by the Met police and for Andrew to face prosecution. “It is not credible to believe that the Met would not have informed senior royals of Andrew’s attempts to use them to smear Giuffre. There are also questions as to why the Met continues to refuse to investigate, interview or charge Andrew,” said Republic’s Graham Smith. “Public anger is what’s going to push this forward and there is a palpable anger among the public who can see that Andrew being stripped of the use of his titles is no punishment at all.” The Guardian published an extract from Giuffre’s posthumous memoir last week in which she detailed her first encounter with the “entitled” prince and said he “believed having sex with me was his birthright”. The Mail on Sunday published messages Andrew allegedly sent to Ed Perkins, then the queen’s deputy press secretary, in 2011 saying he had asked one of his close protection officers to obtain information about Giuffre. According to the messages, Andrew told Perkins he had given the officer Giuffre’s date of birth and confidential nine-digit social security number and claimed she had a criminal record in the US. The email was sent hours before the publication of an infamous picture of Andrew with 17-year-old Giuffre. Her family has said she had no criminal record. There is no suggestion the police officer complied with the request. Another leaked email obtained by the Mail on Sunday suggests that Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, took Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, then 20 and 19, to visit Epstein in New York after he was released from prison. After an newspaper interview given by Ferguson in 2011 in which she said her association with him was a “terrible error of judgment”, Epstein wrote to Paul Tweed, his UK-based lawyer, in April 2011, and said she was “the first to celebrate my release”. A source close to Ferguson said that neither she nor her daughters had any recollection of such a visit."
5,George Santos says prison sentence was ‘disproportionate’ but ‘large slice of humble pie’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/19/george-santos-prison-sentence-commuted,US news,2025-10-19 20:23:41,Olivia Empson,"Disgraced former US congressman George Santos said on Sunday that his prison sentence had been “disproportionate”, but that he had been served “a very large slice of humble pie”, while lashing out at his critics in his first interview since Donald Trump commuted his sentence. Speaking to Dana Bash on CNN’s State of the Union, Santos said he was “all politicked out”, and called for his former campaign staffer, Sam Miele, to also receive a commutation. “This isn’t about ... glitter, stars and glam or going back to Congress,” he said. “This is a very personal journey and road for me ahead.” Related: Disgraced former congressman George Santos released from prison in New Jersey Trump announced on Friday that he had commuted the sentence for Santos, who was meant to serve more than seven years in federal prison in New Jersey after a whirlwind political career tainted by serial fabrications and fraudulent scheming. “I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said in a lengthy Truth Social post. “Good luck George, have a great life!” Santos, who pleaded guilty last year to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, was less than three months into serving time before he was released. He said Trump’s decision to commute his sentence came as a surprise. “I had no expectations, I wasn’t even aware until I learned it off of the chyron of mainstream media inside of the prison myself,” he said. “Other inmates saw it and called me over.” Bash pressed Santos on whether he had received favorable treatment as a “loyal ally” of the president. “There’s a lot of people who were upset with President Biden who pardoned his entire family before he left office in an unprecedented move,” Santos quipped back. “Pardon me if I’m not paying too much attention to the pearl-clutching of the outrage of my critics.” Trump has issued several pardons and commutations during his second term so far, beginning with the “full, complete and unconditional” presidential pardons for about 1,500 people who were involved in the January 6 attack on Congress. In February, he pardoned former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of corruption based crimes, including trying to sell a US Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. As part of his plea deal, Santos had agreed to pay nearly $375,000 in restitution and $205,000 in forfeiture. When asked on State of the Union if he was planning on paying back the restitution, he said if it is “required of me by the law”. “I’ve been out of prison for two days. I agreed to come here to speak with you candidly and openly and not to obfuscate,” he said, visibly frustrated. “If it’s required of me by the law, yes. If it’s not, then no. I will do whatever the law requires me to do.” In a separate appearance on Fox &amp; Friends Weekend earlier on Sunday, Santos said he no longer had to pay restitution and thanked Trump, praising him for having “such an amazing will for second chances”. Back on CNN, he went on to say he was confident that “if President Trump had pardoned Jesus Christ off the cross, he would have had critics. That’s just the reality of our country.”"

7,Slot concedes Liverpool face challenge after Manchester United’s Anfield win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/19/arne-slot-admits-it-will-be-a-challenge-to-lift-struggling-liverpool,Football,2025-10-19 19:56:11,Andy Hunter at Anfield,"Arne Slot said he faces a challenge to lift Liverpool after Manchester United triumphed at Anfield for the first time in more than nine years to inflict a fourth successive defeat on the faltering Premier League champions. The Liverpool head coach blamed wastefulness in front of goal and more set-piece lapses from his team for their latest reverse, as Ruben Amorim savoured the first back-to-back league wins of his United reign. Related: Defensive woes a bigger headache for Slot than getting Isak and Salah to fire | Andy Hunter Harry Maguire, whose 84th-minute header secured victory, admitted it was “embarrassing” that United had taken 51 games to achieve that statistic under Amorim. Slot claimed it should not have been possible for Liverpool to lose a match in which they created so many clear chances. Cody Gakpo struck the woodwork three times and missed a gilt-edged opportunity to head home a second equaliser in the 87th minute. But having lost to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray, Chelsea and now United, the Dutch coach conceded he has a job on his hands to end Liverpool’s damaging run. “As a manager you constantly face challenges,” said Slot. “When you start and you need to win games, when you go to a bigger club, when you are the successor of Jürgen Klopp and people are saying: ‘This is the biggest challenge you have ever faced.’ Now we have lost four times in a row and that is also a challenge. The life of a football manager is also an ongoing challenge. “But do we lose confidence? I can not see that yet because every game we’ve lost we were able to create in the second half an unbelievable amount of chances. If we can keep producing what we are doing and maybe do a few things a little bit better, then there is every reason to expect that we will win football games again. Of course there is also the part that, apart from the two goals we conceded, we conceded maybe two or three more chances. This is constantly the struggle we have when we are 1-0 down, then you need to take a bit more of a risk.” Slot felt the referee, Michael Oliver, should have stopped play before Bryan Mbeumo’s 62-second opener because of a head injury sustained by Alexis Mac Allister. The Liverpool midfielder required four stitches in a cut. But the head coach said: “The main thing I should do now is not complain at these kind of things. We should have done much better after Macca was on the floor but the health care of the players is important and if a player needs four stitches you would hope everyone understands he needed treatment. But we could have done better and that is not the reason we lost. The reason is we missed far too many chances to win a game of football.” Amorim said United’s spirit and composure was key to victory at Anfield, particularly after Gakpo levelled for Liverpool late on, but insisted the finest result of his turbulent reign would not change any targets for the season. The United head coach said: “I want you guys [the media] to continue with the narrative that you have so I will not increase the goal. What we need to do is try to win three games in a row now and forget about top four or top six. We already said we want to go to Europe. This doesn’t change nothing. We are the same team we were 90 minutes ago.” Maguire, however, described the win as “massive” for United as they finally secured two consecutive Premier League wins under the Portuguese coach. United’s match-winner said: “It’s embarrassing really. It’s not a stat that we should even be speaking about because it is an embarrassing stat to have. “Now that’s out of the way let’s try and make it three [wins] on Saturday against Brighton, because we have to start putting a bit more consistency together. The last three or four years we’d put in a performance like this and the following game we come down again. We have set a bench mark, there are a lot of areas we can do more. “The manager strives for perfection so I’m sure he will want us to play better than we did in the second half. Great fight, big spirit, big win, but again we have to go again.”"

A 36-man training squad has been named to prepare for the upcoming autumn internationals, with Jack Willis the most notable omission by Borthwick after the No 8’s decision to return to play in France. The supremely talented Caluori, however, was the 37th name on Borthwick’s list as his players gathered at Pennyhill Park on Sunday night to prepare for Australia’s visit to Twickenham on 1 November. “As part of a development agreement with Saracens Noah Caluori will join the squad for training,” the RFU said. Forwards Fin Baxter (Harlequins), Ollie Chessum (Leicester), Alex Coles (Northampton), Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale), Chandler Cunningham-South (Harlequins), Theo Dan (Saracens), Ben Earl (Saracens), Ellis Genge (Bristol), Jamie George (Saracens), Joe Heyes (Leicester), Emeka Ilione (Leicester), Maro Itoje (Saracens), Nick Isiekwe (Saracens), Asher Opoku-Fordjour (Sale), Guy Pepper (Bath), Henry Pollock (Northampton), Bevan Rodd (Sale), Will Stuart (Bath), Sam Underhill (Bath). Backs Henry Arundell (Bath), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter), George Ford (Sale), Tommy Freeman (Northampton), Ollie Lawrence (Bath), Alex Mitchell (Northampton), Cadan Murley (Harlequins), Max Ojomoh (Bath), Raffi Quirke (Sale), Adam Radwan (Leicester), Tom Roebuck (Sale), Henry Slade (Exeter), Fin Smith (Northampton), Marcus Smith (Harlequins), Ben Spencer (Bath), Freddie Steward (Leicester). In addition, as part of a development agreement with Saracens, Noah Caluori, will join the squad for training. Saracens’ 65-14 round-four demolition of 14-man Sale in the Prem was dominated by Caluori’s finishing prowess, athleticism and aerial ability. Borthwick has immediately responded to calls to involve a player who evidently possesses the qualities to thrive at Test level, despite the headline-grabbing performance over the weekend being the first time he started for Saracens in the Prem. The 6ft 5in wing has represented his country at under-18 and under-20 level. The former England captain Owen Farrell is overlooked by Borthwick, as expected, despite being available again after his return from a spell with Racing 92 and the absence due to injury of the inside-centre Seb Atkinson of Gloucester. Fraser Dingwall, Ollie Lawrence and Henry Slade are among Borthwick’s midfield options – with Tommy Freeman of Northampton also aiming to continue his desired switch to outside-centre. Slade orchestrated Exeter’s dominant 38-0 win against Exeter on Sunday, scoring 23 points, while Harlequins’ Chandler Cunninham-South is included by Borthwick despite going off injured at Sandy Park. Ben Curry of Sale, Bath’s Ted Hill and the Leicester second row George Martin are among those who remain sidelined by injury. After the opener against Australia England face Fiji (8 November), New Zealand (15 November) before rounding off the campaign against Argentina on 23 November."

10,Strictly Come Dancing: week four results – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/live/2025/oct/18/strictly-come-dancing-week-four-live,Television & radio,2025-10-19 19:42:27,Michael Hogan,"8.27pm BST Icons are incoming Thanks as always for watching along with me, sparkly squadron. Our dancefloor dozen now progress to next Saturday’s Icons Week for dances inspired by musical legends. And Usher. This year’s P!nk, anyone? It airs at next Saturday at 6.20pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to debate the precise definition of “legend”. In the meantime, you know full well what I’m going to say: keeeeeeep dancing! Goodnight. 8.26pm BST Finally, emilyscatnaps says: “Well, this sucks. Balvinder and Julian should never have been in the dance-off but I’ve also been rooting for Chris and Nadiya. Chris (unlike some previous slebs) does seem to have tried his very best with something completely new, and I wish he and Nadia could’ve had a week or two more.” Mikemoonlight says: “Shirley votes to save the burly shirtless bloke? I’m shocked, SHOCKED, I tell you.” strictlylounging says: “Gutted for Balvinder that she was in the dance-off again. She was mid-table but a strong performer. Controversial, I know, but I haven’t warmed to her partner (still not a reason for her to be in the dance off and I’m going to give her at least one vote next week). I did vote for Chris, as he was most improved, but in a week of (mainly) strong performances, someone had to go and I get why people saved LaVoix, because that theme and concept was awful and felt unfair.” TruthCounts says: “I suspect Balvinder has more weeks ahead in the dance-off for reasons that are nothing to do with her dancing.” Maldontyke adds: “Nurse for Shirley and Anton please.” 8.20pm BST Yodaknowsall says: “Well, thank goodness for Craig. Even with the mistakes, Balvinder was clearly better than Chris. A travesty avoided.” MollyintheFolly says: “Well, that was all a bit tense. Thank the Strictly deities for Craig and his common sense. Balvinder definitely didn’t deserve to be in the bottom two.” Poppieshen says: “More votes for Balvinder next week. Obviously my one vote wasn’t enough. Although how Shirley and Anton felt that Chris’ stomping and lifting samba was better is beyond me. Where were his hips?” HollyBB adds: “Chris, you excelled in the well-known Strictly skill of standing like a tree while a beautiful dancer whizzes around you.” 8.18pm BST JoMK73 says: “Correct decision from Craig. Still, Chris’ lifts were great and he deserves recognition for that. I think he’s a nice chap.” Webboroonie says: “If they hadn’t messed with the format, Chris would be through! Not great dancing from him but more entertaining than Balvinder who was a bit flat, I felt. When, o when, will Nadia get a partner worthy of her talents?” cubana0104 says: I just knew that Shirley would save Chris and that Anton would follow Shirley’s lead. Thank you, Motsi and Craig, for talking sense.” The MathDiva adds: “Out of the two in the dance-off, that was the right decision imo. There may have been others more worthy of elimination, but what can we do? Vote! That’s what!” Updated at 8.30pm BST 8.15pm BST Readers’ verdicts are in A swift straw poll of your comments. TiggyStardust says: “I’m gutted for Balvinder. Personally I thought that split vote was staged (maybe as a little boost for Chris and/or to inject a note of drama). I think if Craig hadn’t been given the casting vote, it wouldn’t have gone 2:2.” shazza 2704 says “If there is no George, Freddie or Bowie in Icons Week, you can stick it up your Samba” MikeMoonlight adds “I think we can all agree that it’s high time the lovely Nadiya had a decent partner. So considering that I’m about 6 ft 2in, I’m prepared to do the honourable thing and take one for the team by offering my services as her partner next year. Yes, I know, it’s a dirty job but someone has to do it.” Updated at 8.31pm BST 8.12pm BST From zumba to zombies TV viewers can now flip to Channel 4 for Educating Yorkshire or National Geographic for Lost Treasures Of Egypt. At 8.45pm, there’s A Choral Pilgrimage with The Sixteen on BBC4. At 9pm, choose from Riot Women on BBC1 or the Frauds finale on ITV1. At 10.20pm, Star Trek prequel Strange New Worlds gets its terrestrial debut on ITV1. Tonight’s film picks are Shaun Of The Dead (9pm on ITV4), And Then There Were None (9.45pm on Talking Pictures) and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (10.45pm on BBC2). Let’s go to the Winchester, have a nice cool pint and wait for this all to blow over. How’s that for a slice of fried gold? 8.11pm BST Thanks heavens for Revel Horwood If it hadn’t been Craig Revel Horwood’s turn to wield the casting vote, it would likely have been a different result. Shirley Ballas and Anton du Beke both voted to keep Chris Robshaw in the competition, which would have been an injustice. True, both gave Chris and Balvinder Sopal the same score on Saturday night. But did Chris really improve enough in the dance-off to deserve to stay? Balvinder’s atmospheric paso doble was far more accomplished than his stompy salsa. Overall this series, she averages 25 points to his 19. One wonders if they were voting on lifts, effort, personal preference or some other strange logic. The contest’s quality would undoubtedly dip if Balvinder departed and Chris stayed. Luckily, sanity prevailed, thanks to Motsi Mabuse’s vote and Craig’s casting one. It sometimes feels like he’s the only judge who votes with his head, not his heart. Craig must be protected at all costs. Updated at 8.32pm BST 8.09pm BST Nadiya out early yet again You have to feel some sympathy for Ukrainian pro Nadiya Bychkova. She made the quarter-final with Davood Ghadami in her debut series back in 2017 and again four years later with Dan Walker. Apart from those high points, she’s been benched twice and been knocked out before Halloween five times. Due to her height, she’s often paired with strapping sportsmen – see David James, Tom Dean and now Chris – who struggle with the performance side. Yet Nadiya has shown that she’s a great dancer and a good teacher. She’ll be secretly hoping she isn’t lumbered with another retired jock next year. Updated at 8.33pm BST 8.06pm BST La Voix made a miraculous escape Drag queen La Voix, aka Christopher Dennis, last night registered Strictly’s lowest ever week four score with just 14 points - including a damning two from head judge Shirley Ballas. Her cha cha cha was an utter mess of random concept, ill-suited song, godawful costumes and dodgy dancing. Cut adrift by 10 points at the bottom of the scoreboard, La Voix must have got serious public backing to lift her clear of the dance-off. She seemed as surprised as anyone. She’s clearly popular with her castmates, who rushed to give her consolation group hugs, as well as voting viewers. However, she needs to regain form fast or she’ll soon be sashaying away. La Voix now has the lowest average score of any surviving celebrity, slipping below Stefan Dennis. Her pro partner Aljaž Škorjanec needs to pull something much better out of his ballroom bag next week, concentrating on steps rather than quips. Luckily, the Icons Week theme should suit the Drag Race UK runner-up. Updated at 8.34pm BST 8.05pm BST Chris’ exit was correct decision We’ve lost our third male celebrity in a row but it was the right result. Despite coming agonisingly close to an unlikely dance-off victory, former England rugby union captain Chris Robshaw was sent to the Strictly sin bin. His four-week stay was a plucky one. He was one of the few celebrities to improve his score every week and can leave with his head held high, having notched a personal best with 24 points and being fulsomely praised by the judges for his scarlet-clad salsa. Well, the lifts in it, anyway. Robshaw was never the most graceful player on the rugby pitch – more of a mauler than a mover – and was well out of his comfort zone on the dancefloor but he formed a close bond with proud partner Nadiya Bychkova. As a self-styled “dad dancer”, he had to overcome poor posture, nerves and shyness to perform. Despite making those spectacular lifts look effortless, he was never going to become the second consecutive Chris to win (after Mr McCausland). Still, he won new fans and can now attend his mum’s zumba class with new-found confidence. Meanwhile, his sport’s barren run continues. Robshaw was the ninth rugby player to sign up for Strictly but none has ever lifted the glitterball trophy. Maybe if it was egg-shaped rather than spherical, they’d fare better? Updated at 8.34pm BST 8.03pm BST Balvinder’s double dance-off was baffling Why isn’t EastEnders star Balvinder Sopal connecting with voting viewers? She looked gutted to have been consigned to her second successive dance-off. Last week, she was fifth from bottom on the scoreboard. This time she was one place higher but somehow tumbled into the bottom two again. Her fiery, flamenco-flavoured paso doble got a clean sweep of sevens from the judges. There was surely no way it merited a spot in the dance-off, let alone surviving by a split decision. Balvinder is a superior dancer to several of her castmates – La Voix and Stefan Dennis, to name but two – so it would be a great shame if she left too soon. Let’s hope this doesn’t knock her confidence and she comes out fighting like Suki Panesar next time. Updated at 8.35pm BST 8.02pm BST Chris and Nadiya’s last dance As the eliminated pair take a final trip around the ballroom to Don’t You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds – serious Breakfast Club vibes – the credits roll and their castmates crowd in for a scrummage of cuddles. Please stay with us for analysis and reaction. Updated at 8.41pm BST 8.00pm BST Nadiya returns the compliment His pro partner Nadiya Bychkova says: “Chris, I have had a few wonderful weeks with you and saw all the qualities that made you the captain of your country. To watch you go from a non-dancer and non-performer to blossom, improve and develop. On Friday night, when we were rehearsing, you told me that you couldn’t wait to perform on Saturday and that’s the best confirmation that you have got that feeling and love for dance. That means the world. Sometimes on this show you win by getting a glitterball but I feel this year I won just getting you as my partner. ” Aww, sweetly said. 7.59pm BST Chris’ confidence has been boosted In his exit interview, Chris Robshaw tells Tess: “I’ve loved it. I’ve had an amazing partner. For me, coming into this journey, I had no confidence. To be told I had world class qualities on the dancefloor, even though we have to go home, that’s amazing to hear, so thank you very much. It’s given me such confidence. To my partner Nadiya, I’m sorry. But it’s been an amazing journey, she’s been a brilliant teacher, I’ve developed so much, and it’s been a great ride.” Well said, sir. Updated at 8.36pm BST 7.58pm BST Chris Robshaw is eliminated The former England rugby union captain becomes the third celebrity to depart the Strictly 2025 dancefloor. 7.58pm BST Craig Revel Horwood gets the casting vote The sultan of swivel chooses to save Balvinder and Julian, saying “there wasn’t much basic salsa from Chris. Balvinder made mistakes but had better quality and technical ability”. Updated at 8.37pm BST 7.57pm BST Anton Du Beke chooses to save… Chris and Nadiya, saying “stronger execution”. 7.56pm BST Head judge Shirley Ballas chooses to save… Chris and Nadiya, saying “for degree of difficulty and stronger performance”. It’s a split decision for the first time this series. 7.56pm BST Motsi Mabuse chooses to save… Balvinder and Julian, saying “they were different level”. 7.55pm BST Decision time Over to the paddle-raising panel. Craig scored Balvinder three points higher than Chris last night, Motsi one point more but Anton and Shirley gave them both sevens. Updated at 8.36pm BST 7.53pm BST Chris and Nadiya take their turn Chris Robshaw and Nadiya Bychkova reprise their salsa to María by Ricky Martin. The judges said last night that it lacked rotation but featured world championship-standard lifts. It notched 24 points, four fewer than Team Ballion, so he needs to raise the level to close the gap. Updated at 8.39pm BST 7.51pm BST Balvinder and Julian go first in dance-off Balvinder Sopal and Julian Caillon have another go at their paso doble to Diablo Rojo by Rodrigo y Gabriel. The judges said last night that it was committed, intense and atmospheric, with strong skirt-work but lacking the odd detail. It scored 28 points, four more than Chris so you’d think she just needs to maintain last night’s standard. Updated at 8.40pm BST 7.51pm BST Balvinder Sopal faces Chris in dance-off Balvinder and her pro partner Julian Caillon must dance for survival for the second week running. I’m surprised and not a little disappointed by that. 7.50pm BST Chris Robshaw in dreaded dance-off Chris Robshaw and his pro partner Nadiya Bychkova are consigned to the dreaded dance-off, as they were a fortnight ago. 7.49pm BST Final set of results now. Hold tight. 7.49pm BST Anton praises Vicky Pattison’s, yes, saaaarmba.Motsi sympathises with La Voix’s live show cha-cha dis-ah-ster. 7.47pm BST “Are you unwell?” asks Claudia of Craig. 7.46pm BST Dance debrief The fab-u-lous four decamp to the Clauditorium for a closer look at last night’s routines. They praise Alex Kingston’s rumba leg action and Stefan Dennis’ Charleston. Well, to an extent. 7.45pm BST Leigh-Ann gets down on the dancefloor She steps down from the stage to bust a move alongside the pros. You don’t get that from Sir Rod Stewart. 7.43pm BST Never mind the Pinnocks, here’s Leigh-Anne Musical interlude now from Little Mix alumna Leigh-Anne Pinnock, performing this summer’s single Been a Minute. Choreographic accompaniment comes from the benched pros: Michelle Tsiakkas, Luba Mushtuk, Nancy Xu, Jowita Przystał, Gorka Marquez and Neil Jones. Who seem to dressed as Christmas elves, for some inexplicable reason. Updated at 8.41pm BST 7.41pm BST Vicky is &quot;obsessed&quot; with Cheryl Cole Vicky Pattison is dancing as her fellow Geordie next week. Her partner Kai Widdrington does a decent Anton Du Beke impression. Marvellous sarm-ba, my love. Meanwhile, Nitro is being Usher next week for his Argentine tango – and it’s a whopping 13 years since his partner Karen Hauer got to do one. 7.38pm BST Lewis Cope is Johnny Cash He’ll be the quickstepping Man In Black next week. Let’s hope he doesn’t have a burning ring of fire. 7.38pm BST Karen Carney is allowed on Dave Arch's drums Not a euphemism. Or Claudia would we well jeal. Karen will be doing a Celine Dion rumba next week. 7.36pm BST Craig is power crazed The hiss-boo panto villain has been waiting 20 years for this.

Talking of 10s, that’s how many minutes are left to wait… 7.01pm BST Our occasional Canadian correspondent, Iain Crofts, writes: Hi, Michael and Glitter Gang. A stretch of lovely weather with glittering autumnal colours has lured me away from following Michael’s blog while it’s live in the Montreal afternoon so far this season. I’ve loved catching up in the evenings to reconstruct an out-of-UK Strictly experience from your commentary and the BBC’s online clips of the couples’ routines.Not a fan of making couples dance off for Strictly survival, but if it must be done, might I suggest La Voix needs to atone for channelling the hairy monster from the Bugs Bunny cartoons (look it up if you’re too young) in place of Tina Turner? Maybe Harry also needs to have another go with his shirt buttoned up to see if his feet can take some of the weight of the dance off his abs? Perhaps changing the music to the 80s smash by the Pet Shop Boys, “Abdomino dancing”? Can’t wait to find out what happens! Iain in Montreal Updated at 7.03pm BST 7.00pm BST Craig gets the casting vote The panel are taking it in turns this year to cast the deciding dance-off vote. It was announced on last night’s live show that this week, the honour goes to Craig Revel Horwood At least we can rely on him to use it wisely. It’s 15 minutes until the sparkly curtain comes up… 6.55pm BST Pros get suited and booted Tonight’s number from the Strictly professional troupe is a business-themed group tango. Think The Apprentice with Lord Sugar and Baroness Brady in close hold. Enduring image. Twenty minutes until we’re back in the ballroom… 6.50pm BST Did Stefan Dennis do enough to save his skin? Coming into this weekend, bookmakers’ tips for elimination were Stefan Dennis and Chris Robshaw. The latter was left second from bottom of the scoreboard again, so could be in trouble. However, the Neighbours actor bounced back from illness with a cheeky Charleston which notched his best score yet. But will that be backed up by viewer votes? It’s 25 minutes until glitter o’clock… 6.45pm BST Third celebrity set for sparkly scrapheap Someone will miss out on Icons Week and the Halloween Spooktacular. Good evening and welcome to the third elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2025. I’m Michael, your sequins-and-Spanx correspondent for tonight’s results show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as another couple bite the ballroom dust. Following last night’s high-standard hoofing, our 13 pro-celebrity pairings are about to become a dancefloor dozen. The judges’ scores have been combined with the public vote. Now the bottom two will dance one more time in their bid for survival. So who’s at risk of hoofing heartbreak? La Voix was left propping up standings, cut adrift by 10 points after a cha-cha dis-ah-ster, with Chris Robshaw second from bottom. But will voting viewers agree? If not, the likes of Stefan Dennis, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey or even Karen Carney could be in for a nervy night. At the other end of the leaderboard, Alex Kingston notched a perfect 10 for her rumba and totalled 36 points, the second highest score of the series. A moment matched for excitement only by Claudia Winkleman and Dave Arch’s Coldplay kiss-cam spoof. It’s results showtime at 7.15pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 6.45pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and lightly spiced lolz. So snuggle down on this damp autumnal evening and see you on the sofa.

Nearly time to staaaaaart eliminating! 9.16pm BST Thank you and a glittery goodnight - for now That concludes Saturday’s twinkle-toed liveblog but we’ll be back in ballroom hold tomorrow. The results show airs at 7.15pm Sunday on BBC1. I’ll reboot the blog at 6.45pm for build-up, so I hope you’ll rejoin me then. In the meantime, I’m @michaelhogan on Twitter (we still don’t call it X, right?), so please do samba-bounce over and say hi. Thanks for watching along with me and your excellent company as always. Meet you here for the third elimination tomorrow. Predictions welcome. I’d hazard a guess at a La Voix vs Chris Robshaw dance-off with La Voix to go. But this is Strictly, darling, so anything goes. In the meantime, you know what to do: keeeeeep dancing! Take care, my Tumnus-trousered favourites. Updated at 9.55pm BST 9.14pm BST And before I go, it would be frankly remiss of me not to mention that for some autumnal reading – involving mutts, murder and mirth in a seaside setting – my debut novel The Dogwalkers’ Detective Agency has just been published by Penguin Michael Joseph. I see a few of you in the comments are already reading and being lovely about it, which is making me glow like a glitterball. All orders gratefully rewarded with tail-wags and face-licks (don’t worry, not from me). 9.12pm BST Finally, some of your thoughts on Ellie Goldstein’s Couple’s Choice show-closer. joanieloves says: “So much energy and enthusiasm from Ellie. She’s clearly having the time of her life.” ADreamOfWhiteHorses says: “Life affirming.” Jennifera030 says: “Ellie is living her best life and I wish I had a quarter of her confidence and skill. She is great and this dance is bringing me joy.” Toesturnedin says: “Well. I’m very glad to have watched that. Yes I’m very dusty. Who cares? Bloody lovely end to the show.” Somersetlass says: “Oh, Vito. ‘When Ellie comes into the room, everything lights up. All of a sudden the world is in colours’. My heart.” EmmyHarb adds: “I’m so glad that Vito didn’t go down the sweet, schmaltzy route with Ellie’s CC. That was fun and funky. She smashed it!” Updated at 9.18pm BST 9.09pm BST On Amber Davies’ Argentine tango, JoMK73 says: “I loved that AT. Pure filth, not clean as a whistle. Loved the choreography.” Vicc says: “That final shot of Amber and Nikita was excellent. Gave the atmosphere precisely.” Audreyshandbag adds: “They look like they’ve been shat on by the goose that lays the golden eggs!” Updated at 9.19pm BST 9.08pm BST On Chris Robshaw, Poppieshen says: “Nadiya really can dance. Chris can chuck her around but can’t dance.” IvanTiger says: “Chris still needs to loosen up more, but that wasn’t bad and better than before. Fab arms.” Southoftheriver1 adds: “Big improvement from Chris, although he sometimes just forgets to dance and walks between marks. Unbelievable lifts, though.” Updated at 9.19pm BST 9.05pm BST MarkRoche says: “Alex Kingston was sensational but Shirley overcompensating for earlier behaviour, methinks.” heroica says: “I just love Alex and Johannes. That was so beautiful and I’m a bit weepy. The lyrics are poignant.” LazyMillennial says: “The bit in Fast Car where the song just explodes is still one of my favourite moments in popular music.” Shazza2704 says: “Was that a Shirley equivalent of a Paul Hollywood handshake?” anniebygaslight adds: “Greetin’ like a Christmas card for Alex and Jojo.” Updated at 9.20pm BST 9.04pm BST MartGray says of Balvinder Sopal’s paso doble: “Great costumes, authentic music, but horribly distracting laser beams.” MikeMoonlight says: “Balvinder must be the first contestant to actually play their Naan card.” AndyPandy21 adds: “Public .don’t you dare put Balvinder in the dance-off. She does not deserve it. Her moves are very clean and such a good recognisable paso routine with Julian.” Updated at 9.21pm BST 9.02pm BST SparklingDormouse says: “Not good from La Voix. Just didn’t suit her. No hip movement and messy. I’m afraid. Shame as I love the jokes and she’s been better!” bewilderedpenguin says: “Well, that’s a first: Aljaz looking awful. And I loathe boxing. Grump grump grump. Must refill my glass.” MarkRoche says: “Not for the first time, the theme got in the way of the dance. Slightly disappointed with that from La Voix and Aljaz.” MissMartini adds: “I don’t think that was entirely La Voix’s fault. Terrible choreography, music and concept. I think she has more to give, so she may get all my votes.” Updated at 9.22pm BST 9.00pm BST Pancake01 says: “I love George Clarke and I like Alexis. However, I think Alexis has fallen into the trap that many new pros fall into. She needs to make him work on his ‘fundamentals’ more. I think the new pros are so concerned with doing the routine correctly, performing and looking good, and they assume that the celebs have more skill than they actually do. I think George is definitely a dancer though and I want him to go far.” irreverentnurse says: Yes, agree with Anton, George does have a calm quietness about him which I like.” diamondcat adds: “I honestly cannot believe that George hasn’t danced before. He’s extraordinary!” Updated at 9.23pm BST 8.59pm BST On Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, VictoriasSecret says: “Lovely family, nice sentiment. Still don’t approve of Couple’s Choice.” Miranda07 says: “Jimmy totally took me back to my childhood. Just fabulous and he is pure joy personified.” SnailyWhaley says: “Sorry, didn’t love that. I thought Lauren showed him up rather than showing him off.” Somersetlass adds: “Jimmy is a REVELATION! That hip work was wonderful, and he’s got real musicality. The whole dance was full of joy.” Updated at 9.24pm BST 8.57pm BST On Lewis Cope, ReclinedPotato says: “What a gorgeous routine from Katya and Lewis. That dismount from the step ladder was worth an extra point alone.” heroica says: “smooth foxtrot. Didn’t really need that spin on the floor, I thought. Spoilt the mood. Lovely otherwise.” Toesturnedin adds: “Oh. that was cute off the stepladder. I’ll try that with the lads at work.” Updated at 9.25pm BST 8.55pm BST joanieloves says: “Thought that was a great routine from Stefan Dennis. Dianne is a genius at playing to her partner’s strengths.” Jennifera030 says: “That was a big improvement from Stefan, who definitely wasn’t spending last week in remedial dancing classes.” IvanTiger adds: “Once they got round to it, some really nice moves from Stefan, but needed more dance and less staging.” Updated at 9.26pm BST 8.53pm BST On Vicky Pattison’s La Isla Bonita samba, elfwyn says: “I see I’m not the only one who sings ‘Young girl with eyes like potatoes’! Up there with ‘I can see clearly now, Lorraine has gone, I can see four lobster claws in my way.’” Somersetlass says: “Vicky full of party spirit there. Lots of hip and fringe movement (those trousers never stopped moving), and real attitude. Great fun.” LekisP adds: “Loved that from Vicki, she brought the party. Really enjoying her patter.” Updated at 9.27pm BST 8.51pm BST irreverentnurse says: “I do like Harry’s long legs, find him quite graceful given he’s muscle bound, with great posture. MikeMoonlight says: “It’s notable that even Vito has actually worn more buttons this series than Harry.” Lidoswimmer adds: “Not quite as good as Jimmy’s but we’ve had two really decent ‘difficult for the man’ rumbas.” Updated at 9.28pm BST 8.49pm BST Readers’ verdicts are in Time to take the temperature of your comments. On Karen Carney’s quickstep, jagadox says “Carlos seems another pro who has been finding his feet and that quickstep was bright, breezy and bouncy.” Bianco says: “Great song, amazing dress and she seemed to have a good time! A lovely start to the evening!” girlpanic says: “Fab-u-lous from Karen &amp; Carlos. Her feet were great and she seemed to really enjoy it. Her upper body could be more elegant but I loved it overall.” ReclinedPotato adds “Oh, Karen is ever so slightly maniacal when she dances and I absolutely love it. Talk about going glitterballs deep!” Updated at 9.29pm BST 8.47pm BST Hold the front page, it’s the Golden Glitterballs They’re the most coveted made-up awards this side of a Scottish castle where the corridors smell faintly of Celia Imrie’s farts. Here are this week’s gong-grabbers… Best dance: Alex Kingston’s rumba, say the judges. Ellie Goldstein’s showstopper, say I. Worst dance: La Voix’s cha cha travesty by a long chalk. Best music choice: Tracy Chapman’s Fast Car. Also loved Nat King Cole and Dance Monkey. Worst music choice: La Voix’s uneasy combo of music, concept and styling did her no favours at all. Best outfit: A tie between Karen Carney and Alexis Warr’s gowns. Worst outfit: La Voix as Tina Turner-meets-Rocky. Why oh why? Vicky’s Mr Tumnus trews in second place. Best VT: Ellie Goldstein’s proud mum. Something in my eye. Worst VT: Balvinder taking Julian for a curry, merely because it made me hungry. Best judges’ comment: “I heard somebody scream, then I realised it was me” – Anton on Harry’s rumba. Best Claudia quip: That kisscam spoof with her beloved Dave Arch. Be still, my beating satire. 8.38pm BST From cha-chas to chefs You can now flip to BBC2 for 40 Hits Of 1975 at the BBC or to ITV1 for The 1% Club. At 9.20pm, fun plane crash thriller Nine Bodies In A Mexican Morgue continues on BBC1. At 9.45pm, French domestic noir The Intruder climaxes with a double bill on BBC4. Tonight’s film picks are The Menu (9pm on Channel 4), Bone Tomahawk (11.05pm on Film4) or As Good As It Gets (11.25pm on Comedy Central). Good times, noodle salad. 8.38pm BST Witness the week four leaderboard Alex Kingston tops the standings, with Lewis Cope in second spot. La Voix is cut adrift way down at the foot of the scoreboard, 10 points below the rest, with Chris Robshaw second from bottom. As always, though, the viewer vote helps decide which two couples are consigned to tomorrow night’s dance-off. It could be a nervy wait for Stefan Dennis, too. Updated at 9.29pm BST 8.35pm BST Credits roll “Keeeeeep dancing,” trill Tess and Claud, snuggling in. As the sparkly dust settles, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. 8.35pm BST This week's casting vote goes to... Craig gets the honour tomorrow. “About time, darling,” he says. All a bit underwhelming unless it has to be used. 8.33pm BST Tonight’s routines now get rewound on-screen. Which ballroom heroes are you voting for? Which hoofing zeroes are you definitely not? 8.33pm BST And the vote is… wait for it… open! Cue prop-waving pandemonium. Hen party stetsons must be on special offer. 8.32pm BST Judges’ scores: 7, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 31 points. Fourth place. Ellie and Vito’s bond is so beautiful. Caring is sharing. Or is it the other way around? 8.30pm BST Judges’ comments: Anton says “you’re amazing and Vito I literally love you”. Craig says “OMG darling, don’t let your energy move ahead of the beat but that a display of self-expression”. A tearful Motsi says “strong, powerful, your golden moment, really touched me”. Shirley concludes “ending the show with your heart and soul, amazing”. Eights ahoy? Updated at 8.32pm BST 8.27pm BST Ellie and Vito’s Couple’s Choice Pro Vito Coppola says this number is simply a celebration of Ellie Goldstein herself and her groundbreaking, expectation-defying life so far. She’s looking even more sparkly than usual in a gold fringed dress with hot pants and metallic trainers. Powerful shapes and strong streetdance moves. Quirky, happy and full of energy. Jumping around, bouncy as a bunny. Lit up the ballroom and our living rooms. Solo twerking section and a spinning lift. A moment. Song: Golden by HUNTR/X. The second week in a row that we’ve had a song from K-Pop Demon Hunters. Is Dave Arch on commission? Updated at 9.31pm BST 8.22pm BST Judges’ scores: 8, 9, 8, 8 for a total of 33 points. “I’m your biggest fan,” a tearful Nikita tells Amber. Updated at 9.32pm BST 8.20pm BST Judges’ comments: Motsi says “musical, lifts on a different level, fast with sharp steps, so intense that I couldn’t look away”. Shirley says “love the lifts, place the legs and point the feet, otherwise well done”. Anton says “clean as a whistle but felt like hard work rather than reactive”. Craig concludes “loosen the legs, too placed and stagey but you’re incredible”. Eights and nines? 8.17pm BST Amber and Nikita’s Argentine Tango Late arrival Amber Davies and her pro partner Nikita Kuzmin get the honour of dancing the first Argentine of the series. Nikita’s last one was with Layton Williams two years ago and scored 39 points, then a perfect 40 in the final. No pressure. They’ve been training long hours to do it justice. Fast, detailed, intense and packed with steps. Powerful, poised and passionate with close body contact. Intricate kicks and flicks. Connection, chemistry and serious sizzle. She was worried about the lifts but it doesn’t show. Damn, that was good. Song: Angel of My Dreams by JADE. The Little Mixer’s debut solo single samples the 1967 Eurovision-winning Puppet On A String by barefoot Sandie Shaw. Douze points! 8.14pm BST Judges’ scores: 4, 6, 7, 7 for a total of 24 points. They’re jubilant. Nadiya throws enjoyable shade at the male pros for being short and not strapping enough. 8.12pm BST Judges’ comments: Craig says “lacked any rotation but those lifts were extraordinary”. Motsi says “improving every week, nervous to start but strong performance, keep going and opening up”. Shirley says “those lifts were world champion level, needs more rotation downstairs”. Anton concludes “seamless lifts, brilliant, your best dance by far”. Sixes incoming? 8.09pm BST Chris and Nadiya’s salsa Rugby player Chris Robshaw and his pro partner Nadiya Bychkova were delighted to dodge the dance-off with last week’s Thor-themed paso doble but he’s one of the hot tips to depart this week. Can they shake and shimmy out of danger? He’s well out of his comfort zone, bless him, but needs to unleash his hips. He’s been channelling “El Christof” in training to embrace his Latin side. Lacking spice and sauce, a bit slow, stiff and static in places, but scarlet-clad fun with strong, spectacular lifts. Song: María by Ricky Martin. This 1995 flamenco number was the Puerto Rican singer’s first international hit, four years before he went stratospheric with Livin’ la Vida Loca. Updated at 9.33pm BST 8.05pm BST Judges’ scores: 8, 9, 10 (never too early from Shirley), 9 for a total of 36 points. Top of the pops. Alex Kingston and Johannes Radebe. Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA Updated at 9.34pm BST 8.03pm BST Judges’ comments: Shirley says “perfect legs, stunning routine” and comes over to give Alex a kiss. Wow. Anton comes over for a handshake says “well done”. Craig says “exaggerate the topline but legs, balance and tone all there, you’re becoming quite a dancer”. Motsi concludes “different level”. They liked it a little more than me. Nines? Updated at 8.07pm BST 8.00pm BST Alex and Jojo’s rumba The second of two rumbas tonight is from actor Alex Kingston and her pro partner Johannes Radebe. They’ve promised a tender and sensitive take, rather than anything too sexual *purses lips, hitches bosom*. Intensity but occasionally unsteady for me. Dips, drops and drags. Sweeping legs and smooth transitions between movements. Alex said this week that the rumba was her favourite dance so far and that was lovely, leggy storytelling. Song: Fast Car by Tracy Chapman. Her Grammy-winning 1988 debut single about a working woman trying to escape the cycle of poverty. The original version of Dreams by Gabrielle was based around a sample from Fast Car but it couldn’t be cleared, so was removed from the final song. You can imagine it, though, right? Updated at 9.33pm BST 7.56pm BST Judges’ scores: 7, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 28 points. Mid-table. Hope she’s safe this week. Updated at 9.35pm BST 7.54pm BST Judges’ comments: Anton says “much more like it, add consistency and carry this on”. Craig says “a raised shoulder, messy flow and turned-in feet but brilliant arms and hands”. Motsi says “you showedfight and commitment, intense, lacked the odd detail but you lived it, you’re a powerhouse”. Shirley concludes “atmospheric, mishaps as you tired but you worked that skirt superbly, true flavour”. Sevens, do we think? An eight from Motsi? 7.51pm BST Balvinder and Julian’s paso doble EastEnders actress Balvinder Sopal and new Australian pro Julian Caillon – aka “Team Ballion” – survived last week’s dance-off last week but have the ideal dance with which to come out fighting. A traditional paso with bold modern flourishes. Passionate, fiery, flamenco-flavoured and full of intent. Shirley was harsh on Balvinder’s technique and footwork last week, so Julian has been drilling her hard. Skirt-swishing, strong shapes. Lacking a little curve and finished lines but hot as hell. Olé! Song: Diablo Rojo by Rodrigo y Gabriela. The Mexican guitar duo have soundtracked plenty of previous Strictly pasos, including those by Tilly Ramsay, Greg Rutherford, Mike Bushell and Helen Skelton. 7.47pm BST Judges’ scores: 3, 4, 2 (ooh!), 45 for a total of 14 points. Bottom so far, obviously. Consolation cuddles but dance-off danger. 7.45pm BST Judges’ comments: Craig says “like going to the dentist, it left me numb, so much went wrong, no rotation or hip action, legs fully akimbo but I can’t help loving you”. Motsi says “fix the flexibility in your body and leg action but loved the concept and love you”. Shirley says “I can’t judge that at all, got off to a bad start, one of those days”. Anton concludes “it was like you’d never met, good effort, got on with it”. Awkward. Fours? 7.41pm BST La Voix and Aljaž’s cha cha cha Drag queen La Voix showed her serious side last week with a lovely, slow Mary Poppins waltz. Now she’s unleashing her performance skills and bringing the party again with Aljaž Škorjanec. A cha-cha with a clunky, gimmicky boxing theme, married with 80s disco glamour. Channelling Tina Turner. Copious footwork and changes of rhythm. Is she nailing that Cuban leg action? Not fast or flirty enough for me. Beyond Thunderdome but not great for me. Song: Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar. This 1980 power-pop anthem is a big crowd favourite at US sporting events and was covered by Kelly “no relation to Jeremy” Clarkson. Updated at 9.36pm BST 7.37pm BST Judges’ scores: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Second spot as it stands. 7.36pm BST Judges’ comments: Shirley says “fantastic footwork, got lost in the middle, mistakes meant legs became entangled but lots to like, on a good track”. Anton says “lie and you might get away with it but I love your quiet, calm confidence”. Craig says “you would nail it next time, widen the frame, too Argentine for my liking but you led well, you’re really impressing me”. Motsi concludes “fascinating, intense, loved it”. Sevens and an eight or two? Updated at 7.46pm BST 7.32pm BST George and Alexis’ Couples’ Choice Excellent kiss-cam gag from Claudia and Dave Arch. Anyway, from last week’s streetdance-style Couple’s Choice to a ballroom number. George Clarke needs to take charge and lead his pro partner Alexis Warr. Throne-ography to start, then into close hold, travelling flat across the floor. Sharp turns and swivels. Clipped, staccato movements. Perhaps a little lacking in passion and footwork got away from him at times but imperious, sharp, full of wow factor and drama. Strong finish. Catch that on kisscam. Song: Viva La Vida by Coldplay. The 2008 orchestral rock anthem’s Spanish title is taken from a Frida Kahlo painting. It’s been covered by Solange Knowles, Lady Gaga, Weezer, One Direction and Blackpink – and now Sir David Of Arch. Updated at 7.46pm BST 7.28pm BST Judges’ scores: 6, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 29 points. Full of Easter eggs. Not those kind, chocolate chops, just lovely little nods to his family. 7.26pm BST Judges’ comments: Motsi says “very emotional, showmanship improving, get those soca boys back in the dancehalls”. Shirley says “loved all the rhythms, got a little out of sync in the middle but you’re one of the best entertainers this series”. Anton says “a joyous celebration, magnificent”. Craig concludes “needed to be broader with bigger, cleaner shapes but I was loving your energy and commitment”. Eights, do we reckon? 7.24pm BST Jimmy and Lauren’s Couple’s Choice Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink goes back to his roots and throws a freestyle Caribbean party with partner Lauren Oakley. This number is dedicated to his grandparents, set to the music they loved, and his late mother. Plenty of attitude and swagger, full of tropical flavour. Rhythm, hips, groove and lifts. Jumping around joyously when it changes pace at the midway mark. I look forward to the judges trying to critique and score this but it’s irresistible fun. Floor slide and finger points to finish. “I love Soca,” indeed. Song: Soca Medley. Short for “soul of calypso”, the genre originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the 1970s. Updated at 9.39pm BST 7.19pm BST Judges’ scores: 8, 9, 9, 8 for a total of 34 points. Top so far but might not stay there. 7.17pm BST Judges’ comments: Anton says “super-duper, musical, beautiful movement and gorgeous feel but envelop her in your frame and dance together more”. Craig says “too much power sometimes but abundant American smooth feeling”. Motsi says “you’ve gelled so well, incredible, taken refinement to a whole different level, for me you are THE couple”. Shirley concludes “first-class, took it all on board, well done”. Eights, do we think? 7.13pm BST Lewis and Katya’s foxtrot Actor Lewis Cope notched the first perfect 10 of the series for last week’s Zorro paso doble. It was pro partner Katya Jones’ first maximum for eight years, surprisingly. Now he’s back to ballroom. The pressure is on because his lowest score so far was for a Viennese waltz. Lewis needs to show improvement with his feet, frame and leading. Ladder-ography to start. Wind machine in operation. Effortless feel and buttery flow around the floor. Slow, stylish, retro and refined. Jazzy and romantic with a lovely Hollywood feel. A rung above the rest so far. Song: L-O-V-E by Nat King Cole. The 1964 jazz-swing classic was covered by Joss Stone to soundtrack a Noughties ad for Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle fragrance, starring Keira Knightley. Updated at 9.40pm BST 7.10pm BST Judges’ scores: 5, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 26 points. His top score, tied with Harry. 7.08pm BST Judges’ comments: Craig says “stilted and safe, needed more musicality but brilliant storytelling”. Motsi is divorcing Craig and says “your best dance, you had a hit tonight”. Shirley says “back with a bang, coordinated and fantastic choreography”. Anton concludes “character-led and narrative-driven, pulled it off well”. Sixes and sevens again? Updated at 9.41pm BST 7.05pm BST Stefan and Dianne’s Charleston Stefan Dennis is back after his week off with vertigo but can’t ease himself back in. He’s not only tackling the demanding Charleston but he’s bookies’ favourite to go home this weekend. Straight in at the deep end. Table-ography to start and takes too long to get going. Bench-ography stolen from Bill Bailey. Lindyhop style and bags of character, telling a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-style bank robber story. But how about that all-important bounce and swivel? Partner Dianne Buswell having a ball. Cartwheels, lifts, floor slides. A little slow but quirky and well-performed. Song: Dance Monkey by Tones and I. Another Australian artist for the all-Aussie couple. This record-breaking 2019 electro-pop hit topped the Australian singles chart for six months and the UK chart for 11 weeks. Blimey. Updated at 9.40pm BST 7.01pm BST Judges’ scores: 7, 7, 7, 8 for a total of 29 points. “I know my Charleston didn’t tickle Shirley’s pickle,” says Vicky. “But I wanted to impress her with this.” Her highest score yet. Updated at 9.43pm BST 7.00pm BST Judges’ comments: Shirley says “still improving, appreciate the difficult footwork, executed well, fix your arms and frame but steadily on the up”. Anton says “marvellous, not the finished product, cut loose and give it more power”. Craig says “needed sharper arms, light and shade but technically and performance-wise very good”. Motsi concludes “infectious fun, needed more body movement, went crazy in the solo parts”. Sevens ahoy? 6.56pm BST Vicky and Kai’s samba The Geordie lass’s confidence is gradually growing and so are her scores, which have been creeping up by one point each week. Getting into the groove now with a Rio carnival dance. Solo section in Mr Tumnus trousers to start. Rhythmical with fluid hip movements. Supple and synchronised with natural bounce action. Body rolls and ripples. Lacking a little musicality and off the beat in patches, bless her, but much better in the side-by-side sections. Did well with a tough routine. Song: La Isla Bonita by Madonna. The 1987 Latin pop hit was rejected by Michael Jackson before Madge picked up the track and added her own lyrics. Altogether now: “Young girl with eyes like potatoes…” Updated at 9.42pm BST 6.52pm BST Judges’ scores: 6, 7, 6, 7 for a total of 26 points. One fewer than Karen Carney. 6.50pm BST Judges’ comments: Anton says “intense, good timing and beautifully choreographed but needed more hip movement”. Craig says “lacked fluidity, dance the whole dance but you presented Karen well”. Motsi says “partnering skills were great, energy in the body, full of chemistry but needed more body motion”. Shirley concludes “challenging routine, storytelling good but seamless fluidity from foot to foot is your next project”. Sixes and sevens again? 6.46pm BST Harry and Karen’s rumba Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, aka Nitro from Gladiators, and partner Karen Hauer notched their highest score with last week’s pec-tacular Lion King salsa. The only slow Latin dance might be more of a challenge. It’s notoriously tricky for celebrity males but Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink did a decent one last week. Harry needs to put his power and energy aside to tap into his musicality. Blue lighting. Pecs and six-pack out again. Sensual, rhythmic and romantic but not enough sizzle. Oozing and undulating. Lacking a little control at times and too stop-start, needing more continuous flow rather than pose-striking. Harry seems a little too upright to me, should be more earthy. Song: It Must Have Been Love by Roxette. The power ballad (just belted out karaoke-style by the judges) memorably soundtracked the climactic scene of Richard Gere/Julia Roberts romcom Pretty Woman. Big mistake. Huge. Updated at 9.44pm BST 6.44pm BST Claudia on smallprint duties They seem to have retired the surprise Clauditorium guests and the woman herself reads out the voting Ts &amp; Cs. Online-only, remember. Don’t come around here with your old-fashioned “phone vote”, you dance dinosaurs. 6.42pm BST Judges’ scores: 6, 7, 7, 7 for a total of 27 points. Up on last week. 6.41pm BST Judges’ comments: Motsi says “sassy and elegant, shining bright with a beautiful ending, I forgive the slip on the dress”. Shirley says “an improvement on your tango, outstanding energy but a little bit of gapping”. Anton says “grace, focus, tuck your legs under but clearer footwork, enjoyed it”. Craig concludes “slipping happens to the best of us, darling, quieten the topline and turn out your feet but I can’t wait to see you do a Charlestons”. Sevens, are we saying? 6.38pm BST Karen and Carlos’ quickstep Former Lioness Karen Carney has dipped in the past two weeks and been nervous about going back to ballroom. The judges told her that she’s power-packed but needs refinement and finesse, so let’s see if she and partner Carlos Gu has taken note. She needs to nail the details, show quality and be “Karen Classy”. Swingtime storytelling, then into hold. Fast, frothy, smooth and elegant. Bright and light on her feet as she flies around the floor but the odd heavy, hesitant step. Bouncy Charleston steps. Bags of fun, classic styling and a floor spin to finish. Song: Marvellous Party by Beverley Knight. The soul diva’s interpretation of the Noël Coward standard originally featured on the soundtrack to ITV wartime hotel drama The Halcyon. Remember that? Updated at 9.45pm BST 6.34pm BST Our Strictly stars™ First sighting of our couples as they come out for a welcome wave. Outfits are pleasingly restrained compared to last week’s Movie Week fancy dress. Harry Aikines-Aryeetey has put his shirt back on but forgotten to button it up. Chris Robshaw has removed his Thor wig. La Voix in some sort of novelty boxing rig-out. 6.32pm BST Here come the hoofing inspectors, Judges Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas make their big entrance. Synchronised sit-down as per. 6.32pm BST Frockwatch Our presentational pair arrive, so time for our weekly couture comparison. Tess Daly is in one-shouldered trouser suit. Claudia Winkleman is in a white tuxedo. La Winkle wins. 6.31pm BST Cue clapalong credits Two males have left so far, with Tom Skinner and Ross King becoming the first two celebrities to depart the dancefloor. Who’s next for the choreographic chop? 6.30pm BST And we’re off! Roll the industry standard scene-setting, tension-building montage. 6.28pm BST Replenish your drinks and refill your nibbles ramekins. We’re about to go over live to Elstree Studios… 6.25pm BST Could bullfight spell danger for Balvinder? Stats say that the paso doble has led to the most week four eliminations in Strictly history. And tonight, dance-off survivor Balvinder Sopal is tackling it. An ominous sign? Just five minutes until the glittery gong strikes… 6.20pm BST On your dance cards tonight An eclectic menu this week with 11 different dance styles. The only overlaps are a pair of rumbas and a couple of, er, Couple’s Choices. Heaven help us. A mere 10 minutes to wait now… 6.15pm BST Amanda Holden-hosted quiz The Celebrity Inner Circle just winding up on BBC1 now. Still no idea of the rules but Strictly alumni Montell Douglas and Colin Jackson were competing in this episode, so it’s not all bad. 6.14pm BST Icons Week beckons The couples are bidding to get through to Strictly’s second ever Icons Week next Saturday, with dances inspired by musical legends.

11,Defensive woes a bigger headache for Slot than getting Isak and Salah to fire | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/19/defensive-woes-a-bigger-headache-for-arne-slot-liverpool-than-getting-isak-and-salah-to-fire,Football,2025-10-19 19:30:35,Andy Hunter at Anfield,"The time has come to start judging Alexander Isak fairly as a £125m Liverpool centre forward, Arne Slot said on Friday. In that case judgment must be harsh but, as Britain’s most expensive footballer sat alongside Mohamed Salah on the Liverpool bench while the Premier League champions tried in vain to force an equaliser against Manchester United without them, it was not Slot’s misfiring forward line that warranted the fiercest criticism at Anfield. His defensive foundation has evaporated. Related: Manchester United end wait for Anfield win as Maguire header stuns Liverpool Yes, Isak was largely anonymous in the No 9 role and Salah again poor as his individual toils continued against the club he usually plunders. The Sweden international had his first shot on target in the Premier League as a Liverpool player in the 35th minute, well saved by United’s latest goalkeeper Senne Lammens. Salah squandered a glorious second-half chance in front of the Kop and neither could complain when their numbers eventually came up. Cody Gakpo also struck the woodwork three times and somehow failed to score a second moments after Harry Maguire’s winner. It should have been impossible for Liverpool to lose a game in which they created so many chances, Slot claimed. But it is not impossible with a defence in this form, as Crystal Palace, Chelsea and now United have proven. As he presided over a fourth successive defeat as Liverpool head coach, the first man to do so since Brendan Rodgers in November 2014, Slot must have despaired at a defensive performance that invited United to take the initiative as well as their first victory at Anfield since January 2016. Littered with the same mistakes that Liverpool’s coaching staff had worked on eradicating after the international break, including another set-piece goal, it was a display that completely derailed the champions’ second half recovery and cost them the game. Momentum was finally with the hosts when Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s early breakthrough. Liverpool could sense another late victory with substitutes Hugo Ekitiké, Curtis Jones and Federico Chiesa sparking improvement and United in retreat. Instead it was another late Premier League defeat, the third in succession, after Liverpool’s set-piece frailties re-emerged and Maguire found himself one of three United players unmarked behind Ibrahima Konaté in the 84th minute. A thumping header into the goal that Maguire blazed over in the dying seconds of last season’s 2-2 draw gave Ruben Amorim the finest win of his turbulent United reign. For all the negativity surrounding Amorim it was his team that performed with clear purpose and a well-executed plan for the majority of a compelling contest. The first back-to-back league wins of Amorim’s reign were the result. Slot’s side again looked like strangers at times, particularly when conceding a set-piece goal for the fifth time in the Premier League this season. Liverpool were found wanting from the inception to the execution of Mbeumo’s 62-second opener. There was no purchase on the initial header from Virgil van Dijk, a likely consequence of having to go through two players to connect with the ball, admittedly, and no pressure on Bruno Fernandes when he took possession and released Amad Diallo in space on the right. Milos Kerkez was slow to react, Van Dijk slow to track back and follow Mbeumo’s run while Giorgi Mamardashvili, deputising for the injured Alisson in goal, was easily beaten from the angle. Related: Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Slot could justifiably point to his head and ask where the whistle was from Michael Oliver, a referee with whom he has a feisty history, but also question the concentration and communication levels among his defenders. Mbeumo’s strike means Slot’s team have kept only two clean sheets in 12 matches this season, the last coming eight games ago at Burnley. United carved open Liverpool’s left flank repeatedly in a first half in which Fernandes, Mason Mount and even Gakpo all came close to doubling the visitors’ lead. Releasing Diallo early against Kerkez was clearly part of Amorim’s gameplan. It succeeded time and again in the opening 45 minutes. The £40m summer signing from Bournemouth endured another difficult evening in a Liverpool shirt. Throw-ins were even a problem for Andy Robertson’s chosen successor, who almost put Mbeumo through on goal while making one interception. Kerkez and Van Dijk appear on different wavelengths at present. “We take a lot of risks,” Slot explained after United’s victory. “After the 62nd minute we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch. That’s maybe why our structure for the set-piece was not as perfect as we usually are. Usually we would have more defensive players on the pitch. Maybe it is a coincidence but it is not an excuse. We know we have to do better.”"
12,Dead fish found on River Thet where large stretch of white foam appeared,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/19/dead-fish-found-on-river-thet-where-large-stretch-of-white-foam-appeared,UK news,2025-10-19 19:17:26,Morgan Ofori,"Dead fish have been found on a river in Norfolk where a large stretch of white foam appeared, the Environment Agency has confirmed. Images shared by the agency on Saturday showed the foam covering an area of the River Thet. The Environment Agency said its officers had “seen small dead fish and fry”. It said it was investigating the incident and “the pollutant is an unknown substance”. Specialist teams were sent to collect samples from the river, which flows through Thetford, on Saturday with the aim of finding the source of the pollution and preventing further discharge. The source of the foam, which remains visible, was detected and further discharge stopped. Firefighters also attended and Norfolk fire service warned people not to enter the water or allow their pets to swim in or drink from the river. Anglian Water confirmed there was a “third party” involved and was not from any of their “equipment or assets in the area”. An Environment Agency spokesperson said that further foam might occur but had said it would have “little environmental impact as it dissipates”. They said: “Environment Agency officers are continuing to investigate the cause of a large volume of foam found in the River Thet in the centre of Thetford, yesterday. “Our specialist teams have collected samples, detected the possible source, and prevented any further discharge. There will be an ongoing investigation to try to ensure that this does not happen again. “It is possible that we might see a second foam plume today and the foam will continue to travel down the river. It is still visible but will have little environmental impact as it dissipates.” On Sunday the agency said it would wait until the pollutant had gone to assess the longer-term effects. They added that its officers had attended an incident involving foam on the River Thet on 23 December 2024 but were unable to identify the source on that occasion."
13,Louvre heist: hunt on for thieves after eight ‘priceless’ jewellery pieces stolen,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/19/louvre-closed-after-robbery-french-culture-minister-says,World news,2025-10-19 19:07:50,Angelique Chrisafis in Paris ,"French police are hunting four thieves who carried out a highly professional daylight raid on the Louvre, breaking into one of the museum’s most ornate rooms and escaping with eight pieces of “priceless” historic jewellery, including a necklace given by Napoleon to his wife. The world’s most-visited museum was suddenly closed for the day on Sunday after the break-in targeted pieces in two glass cases in its Apollon gallery, where the French crown jewels are held. A crown worn in the 19th century by Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III, was found broken near the museum after the thieves fled. It features golden eagles and is covered in 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds. The French culture ministry said eight items of jewellery were stolen, including an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon gave to his wife, Marie Louise. Other jewels stolen included a sapphire necklace and sapphire earrings worn by Napoleon’s stepdaughter Hortense, who became the queen of Holland, and which was also worn by the 19th-century queen Marie Amélie. The French interior minister, Laurent Nuñez, visited the scene and told France Inter radio that “priceless” jewels “of unmeasurable heritage value” were stolen after what was clearly a well-organised raid. The thieves struck at 9.30am local time on Sunday and Nuñez said it took them seven minutes to make off with the jewels. He said: “They stole jewels which have a real heritage value, an inestimable heritage value.” The thieves approached the building from the outside, at an area where building work was taking place. A truck and a basket lift were used to access the museum. They used an angle grinder and power tools to break windows and enter. Nuñez said it was the work of “an experienced team who had clearly scouted the location”. He said three or four suspects had fled – their route was known and police were investigating whether it was a gang known to them for other crimes. Investigators were studying footage from security cameras. Nuñez would not confirm what jewels were taken but said the thieves targeted two glass cases. The gilded Apollon gallery of the Louvre, the ornate decoration of which was commissioned by the Sun King, Louis XIV, has a collection of historic crowns, diadems and sovereign jewellery. It is one of the museum’s most spectacular rooms. Pieces usually on display there include three historic diamonds, the Regent, the Sancy and the Hortensia. The Paris prosecutor, Laure Beccuau, said the thieves did not target or steal the world-famous Regent diamond kept in the same gallery. Interactive Nuñez said the museum was evacuated to preserve evidence and to allow investigators and forensics teams to carry out their work. He later wrote on social media: “Targeting the Louvre is targeting our history and our heritage.” The Paris prosecutor has opened an inquiry into the theft and work is under way to estimate the value of the stolen pieces. Police are hunting for four thieves. The culture ministry said alarms went off when the display cases were opened and museum security guards intervened and called police. The thieves fled, leaving their equipment behind them. Le Parisien newspaper reported that the thieves had been dressed in building attire, wearing yellow hi-vis jackets. The French culture minister, Rachida Dati, was first to announce the incident. “A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre museum,” she wrote on social media. She used the French word braquage, which can mean robbery or hold-up. She added: “No injuries reported. I’m on site with museum staff and police.” Dati confirmed that one stolen piece of jewellery was recovered outside the museum where the thieves had fled. At least one person had entered the museum, a member of her team told Agence France-Presse, without adding anything about any possible theft. The Louvre said it was closing for the day “for exceptional reasons”, without providing further details on what had been stolen. Politicians were quick to react. Ariel Weil, the Socialist mayor of Paris’s central area, said he was “shocked” and that it seemed like a storyline from a film. He told Le Parisien: “It’s hard to imagine that it was seemingly so easy to burgle the Louvre.” Jordan Bardella, the president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party, said: “The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture. This robbery, that has allowed thieves to take the jewels of the French crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country.” The office of the president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was following events closely. One of the largest arts centres on the planet, the Louvre attracts more than 8 million visitors a year. Its works range from classical sculpture to the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci’s 16th-century masterpiece and the world’s most famous portrait. In January, Macron announced a big renovation of the museum after its director said that visiting the overcrowded building had become a “physical ordeal”. In a note to the cultural ministry leaked to the media in January, the Louvre’s director, Laurence des Cars, had said the space below the museum’s glass pyramid entrance was not properly insulated from the cold or heat, tended to amplify noise, and was uncomfortable for the public and the staff. Des Cars also raised the alarm over water leaks, failing infrastructure and temperature swings that endanger the conservation of works of art. Visitors faced overcrowding and substandard facilities, she said. The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous was in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame. An Italian painter and decorator, Vincenzo Peruggia, had hidden all night in a museum cupboard before taking the picture from its frame and leaving the building, apparently unseen. It was 24 hours before anyone noticed the painting was missing. The poet Guillaume Apollinaire and the painter Pablo Picasso were both questioned by police. The painting was recovered three years later in Florence and returned to Paris. The most recent theft in the Louvre dates to 1998, when a painting by the 19th-century French artist Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was removed from the wall. It has never been found, but its disappearance led to a review of security at the museum. Several museums across France have been targeted by thieves in recent months. Last month, criminals used an angle grinder to break into Paris’s Natural History Museum, stealing gold samples with a street value of €600,000 but priceless to scientists and researchers. Last November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay Museum in Paris targeting a popular exhibition, Pocket Luxury, which featured small precious objects from the 18th century. Seven valuable tobacco boxes were stolen, some of which had been on loan from the Louvre and the UK’s royal collection. When Macron pledged this year that the Louvre would be “redesigned, restored and enlarged”, he said he hoped the annual number of visitors would rise to 12 million."
14,"National Dance Company Wales: Surge review – mythical monsters, soulful swingers and an alien chorus line",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/19/national-dance-company-wales-surge-review-the-place-london,Stage,2025-10-19 19:00:21,Lyndsey Winship,"The sequins are sensational; the dancers pretty special too. Clad in skin-tight black glittering bodysuits and masks – the full Leigh Bowery – it is a look: gorgeous with an undercurrent of unnerving. There’s a confidence on all fronts in the work of Marcos Morau, which befits a multi-award-winning choreographer who graces major stages with his own company La Veronal, but also has an ongoing relationship with the small National Dance Company Wales. In Waltz (2023) the ideas aren’t overcrowded. Morau’s dancer-creatures emerge like an alien chorus line, bodies entwined in geometric formations like a sci-fi Busby Berkeley. The highly ordered machine breaks down into separate parts, dancers in stop-start motion, their beguiling and peculiar appearance not dissimilar to the dislocated postures of Sharon Eyal or Wayne McGregor. Perhaps the novelty is exhausted before the time runs out, but there’s pleasing clarity, and it looks damn cool. This triple bill actually begins with the short Infinity Duet by Faye Tan: two dancers and a swinging sculpture like a trapeze (by Cecile Johnson Soliz). Airy guitar music brings the warmth and ease of a hazy summer day, its breeze – and the pendulum-like sway of the sculpture – setting the dancers in motion. I was waiting for them to start swinging, but it wasn’t that kind of show. We like to celebrate dance being such an international art form, but at the same time, it’s great to see NDCWales doing something as thoroughly Welsh as Osian Meilir’s Mabon, based on the ancient stories and legendary creatures of the Mabinogion. An eerie tone is set by the score of harpist Cerys Hafana, who electronically manipulates traditional music into something futuristic with driving dance rhythms and ethereal voice. Becky Davies’ creature costumes are fantastic, as if she’s gone on a wild rampage through the haberdashery: fur, feathers, fringing and pearls; masks of abstracted animal faces whose markings look like giant eyes to scare off predators. They gradually shed their robes so you can actually see them dancing, and jig and whoop in ritual circles. Meilir’s roots in Welsh folk dance are clear; less clear is the sense of these characters’ quest (to find the mythical Mabon ap Modron) but this is a delightfully unique piece. • At Aberystwyth Arts Centre, 6 November; then Dance East, Ipswich, 21-22 November"

In a statement released by the Bladensburg police department in Maryland, they announced that the driver of the striking vehicle had turned himself in and had been identified as a 66 year-old man from the surrounding area. “The hit and run vehicle collision has been updated to a fatality,” they announced in an update on Sunday. Officers were called to the scene shortly after 10pm, where the vehicle had struck several people gathered outside a home for a child’s birthday party. Eleven people were taken to local hospitals, including children ranging in age from two to nine. The driver fled the scene of the incident on foot but eventually handed himself in to authorities. In a statement on social media, the Prince George’s county fire and emergency medical services department confirmed that one woman and child had been transported in critical condition.

16,England hold nerve to beat India and seal Women’s Cricket World Cup semi-final spot,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/19/england-hold-nerve-to-beat-india-and-seal-womens-cricket-world-cup-semi-final-spot,Sport,2025-10-19 18:25:39,Raf Nicholson,"England won a last-over thriller against India at Indore on Sunday to seal their place in the World Cup semi-finals, holding two crucial catches at the death to defend 288 and win by just four runs. Earlier Heather Knight’s third ODI century in her 300th international set up the exciting finale. India were left needing 27 off 18 but, defying England’s recent ­reputation of falling to pieces under pressure, Linsey Smith conceded just four runs from the 48th over and then defended 14 off the last to ensure ­England came out on top. Related: England beat India by four runs to book World Cup semi-final spot – as it happened Smith had earlier taken the crucial wicket of Smriti Mandhana, whose 88 from 94 balls looked to be taking India to a straightforward victory until, hobbling with cramp caused by the sweltering humidity, the Indian vice-captain sent a catch into the hands of long-off with 55 runs still needed. Still, with six wickets in hand, the match was India’s to lose, and their clutch all-rounder Deepti Sharma hit just enough boundaries to keep them in touch, bringing up her half-century in the 46th over. But Richa Ghosh holed out to Knight at cover the very next ball, before Deepti herself slog-swept into the hands of Sophia Dunkley at deep midwicket in the next over, leaving too much for Amanjot Kaur and Sneh Rana to do. Tournament hosts India are now fighting it out with New Zealand for the fourth semi-final spot and will need to beat the White Ferns on Thursday – plus avoid defeat in their final match against Bangladesh – to be sure of qualification. “I can’t quite comprehend what’s just happened,” Smith told Sky Sports. “The fight that we showed at the end there was amazing. For me, it was trying not to overcomplicate it too much. I’ve been practising that death plan all week, trying to bowl a tight line into their heels.” With both teams still pushing for a place in the semi-finals, this was the tournament’s standout crunch match to date, and the capacity Indore crowd were treated to a ­nailbiter – albeit not the result they had been hoping for. Knight’s century enabled England to post 288 after choosing to bat first. “I was desperate to put in a statement performance on a big-cap occasion and I’m really pleased that I did that,” Knight told Sky Sports. It was a formidable total that would have required India to pull off a record run-chase – but nonetheless there was a feeling that England had undershot on a very good batting track. Knight’s run-out in the 45th over, wrongly chancing the arm of Amanjot Kaur at deep square leg, proved to be the catalyst for a very on-brand collapse: England lost five wickets for 31 runs and what should have been a 300+ total crashed and burned. The head coach, Charlotte Edwards, who had chosen to keep the faith with her established lineup despite unconvincing showings against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, might well have raised an eyebrow in the dugout. Deepti finished with a return of four for 51, seeing off both Alice Capsey and Emma Lamb in successive overs at the death. The Capsey dismissal was a smart piece of cricket to a poor piece of decision-making: Deepti spotted the batter’s pre-­meditated reverse, adjusted her line, and tangled her up so much that the ball ended up in the hands of cover. Earlier, India’s swing-queen Renuka Singh Thakur – brought back into the XI for this match due to ­England’s recent struggles against new-ball movement – had been unlucky to finish wicketless after a hooping five-over opening spell. Instead, it was Deepti who broke ­England’s 73-run opening ­partnership in her first over of the day, ­bowling Tammy Beaumont round her legs. However, England’s tormentor with the ball could not quite finish the job with the bat. “I’m so, so happy,” a relieved Nat Sciver-Brunt told Sky Sports. “We haven’t really been tested towards the end of our innings with the ball. Everyone showed how calm they were and were really clear in what they wanted to do.” Meanwhile her opposite number, Harmanpreet Kaur, will be as much under pressure as ever, despite her own run-a-ball 70 in Indore. India once again failed to use the DRS ­system effectively: twice in the ­England innings they reviewed ­on-field decisions which replays showed were drifting down leg, ­taking their tally of unsuccessful reviews up to eight. It might not have cost them the match against England but if the trend continues it could yet cost them a place in the semi-finals."

The 52-year-old follows Steven Gerrard in failing to agree a deal with the Rangers hierarchy despite detailed and advanced discussions. Danny Röhl, who has admirers on the Ibrox board, ruled himself out of the running after Muscat emerged as a clear favourite. The off-field scenario at Rangers appears increasingly chaotic. Related: Celtic fail to cut Hearts lead after dismal defeat to Dundee amid fan protests Muscat’s situation will do little to ease pressure on Rangers’ beleaguered executives, who have been subjected to protests from supporters. The Shanghai Port manager, who played briefly for Rangers, had apparently been keen on succeeding Russell Martin. Muscat was also likely to remain in China in the short term, as his team looks to win a second title in succession. Shanghai Port’s league season will not finish until 22 November. Undeterred, Rangers started talks with Muscat last week and were confident of a positive outcome. Rangers sacked Martin after just 123 days, two weeks ago. Despite promising an “urgent” recruitment process, Rangers have now suffered public embarrassment via Gerrard and Muscat. Steven Smith, Rangers’ under-19 coach, took charge for the 2-2 draw with Dundee United at Ibrox on Saturday. Rangers trail the Scottish Premiership’s early pacesetters, Hearts, by 13 points having taken just nine from eight matches.

19, Trump calls Colombia president ‘illegal drug dealer’ as US says it hit another ship,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/19/trump-colombia-gustavo-petro,US news,2025-10-19 18:16:07,Olivia Empson,"Donald Trump on Sunday accused Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, of being an “illegal drug dealer” and threatened to immediately cut US funding to the country as the defense secretary confirmed in a social media post an attack on a vessel associated with a Colombian leftist rebel group. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday that US forces had attacked another vessel, this time associated with a Colombian leftist rebel group. Hegseth, in a post on X, said “three terrorists were killed” in the operation which was “conducted in international waters”. “These cartels are the Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are – they will be hunted, and killed.” In a post on Truth Social just hours earlier, Trump blamed the South American leftwing leader for encouraging the mass production of illegal drugs, saying he “does nothing to stop it, despite large-scale payments and subsidies from the US”. “Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately,” Trump wrote, “or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely”. The remarks come after Petro said the US committed “murder” following a strike on an alleged drug boat in Colombian territorial waters in September. Posting on X on Saturday, Petro said: “US government officials have committed a murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,” adding “we await explanations from the US government.” Related: US military to move survivors of strike on alleged drug boat in Caribbean to nearby countries The threat to cut off aid marks the latest point of tension between the two nations, despite historically, Colombia being one of the United States’s closest allies in Latin America. The victim of the strike was identified by Petro as Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He was allegedly killed when US forces fired at his boat on 15 September. “Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing,” Petro wrote. “The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.” But Trump has continued to justify the necessity for these ongoing boat attacks, despite his administration offering little information about the vessels or the identities of those on board. On Thursday, the US moved to send two survivors of the most recent strike – the sixth since early September – overseas instead of seeking long-term military detention for them. “The two surviving terrorists are being returned to their Countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for detention and prosecution,” Trump said. The strike targeted a semi-submersible vessel which the president said “was loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics.” Two crew members were killed and experts said the decision to repatriate the survivors meant the US military would avoid complex legal questions surrounding the detention of suspected drug traffickers. This was the first recorded instance of there being survivors, an official told NBC. “It was my great honor to destroy a very large DRUG-CARRYING SUBMARINE that was navigating towards the United States on a well known narcotrafficking transit route,” Trump posted in the aftermath of the attack. So far, at least 29 people have been killed in strikes the administration upholds are targeting drug traffickers, raising alarm among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether they adhere to the laws of war. Currently, the US is building up a prominent military presence in the Caribbean and bordering coastlines, one that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 jets, and the authorization of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. Colombia is the recipient of the largest amount of US aid to any country in Latin America and former president Joe Biden designated the nation as a major non-Nato ally in 2022. While Congress allocated $377.5m for foreign assistance for the country in 2024 with similar projections for 2025, there were restrictions put in place out of concern for Petro’s policies and his efforts to counteract the drug trade. In September, the Trump administration asserted that Colombia was failing to cooperate in the drug war, adding them to a list of other nations for the first time in almost 30 years. More recently, they said they would revoke Petro’s visa while he was in New York for the UN general assembly after his “reckless” actions at a pro-Palestine protest. Petro had urged US soldiers to “disobey Trump’s order”, and “not point their rifles at humanity”. In reaction to Trump’s most recent accusations and funding cuts, Petro responded in a post on X saying: “I respect the history, culture, and people of the USA. They are not my enemies, nor do I feel them as such.” He added at the end: “The problem is with Trump, not with the USA.”"
